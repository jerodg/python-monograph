    """This function finds the equilibrium index of an array. The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that
    the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. The function uses a
    brute force approach to find the equilibrium index by iterating over the array and for each index, it calculates
    the sum of elements on the left and right. If the sums are equal, it returns the index. If no equilibrium index
    is found, it returns -1.

    Parameters:
        arr (list): The input array for which to find the equilibrium index.

    Returns:
        int: The equilibrium index if found, otherwise -1.
