def equilibrium_index(arr: list) -> int:
    """
    This function finds and returns the equilibrium index of an array. The equilibrium index of an array is an index
    such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. If no such index
    exists, the function returns -1.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers representing the array.

    Returns:
        int: The equilibrium index of the array if it exists, otherwise -1.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list.
        ValueError: If the list contains non-integer elements.

    Doctest:
        >>> equilibrium_index([-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0])
        3
        >>> equilibrium_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        -1
        >>> equilibrium_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1])
        3
        >>> equilibrium_index([20, 10, -80, 10, 10, 15, 35])
