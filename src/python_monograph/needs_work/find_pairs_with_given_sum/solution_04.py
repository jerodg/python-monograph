def solution_04(arr: List[int], req_sum: int) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    This function returns the number of pairs in the input list `arr` that sum up to `req_sum` and a list of the pairs using a
    brute force approach.

    It uses a brute force approach, checking every possible pair of numbers in the array. If a pair sums up to the target sum,
    it increments the count and adds the pair to the list.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.
        req_sum (int): The required sum.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: The number of pairs in `arr` that sum up to `req_sum`, and a list of the pairs.

    Doctests:
    >>> solution_04([1, 5, 7, 1], 6)
    (2, [(1, 5), (5, 1)])
    >>> solution_04([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
