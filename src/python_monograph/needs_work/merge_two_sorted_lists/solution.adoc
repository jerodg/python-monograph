==== Explanation

The provided code is a Python implementation of a function that merges two sorted linked lists.
The function is named `method_0` and it takes two parameters, `l1` and `l2`, which are instances of the `ListNode` class.

The `ListNode` class is a simple data structure with two attributes: `val` and `next`.
The `val` attribute holds the value of the node, and the `next` attribute points to the next node in the list.

[source,python,linenums]
----
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None
----

The `method_0` function starts by creating a dummy node, `dummy`, and a pointer, `current`, that points to this dummy node.
The dummy node is used to keep track of the head of the new merged list.

[source,python,linenums]
----
dummy = ListNode(0)
current = dummy
----

The function then enters a loop that continues as long as both `l1` and `l2` are not `None`.
Inside this loop, it compares the values of the nodes pointed to by `l1` and `l2`.
The node with the smaller value is appended to the new list, and the pointer (`l1` or `l2`) is moved to the next node.

[source,python,linenums]
----
while l1 and l2:
    if l1.val < l2.val:
        current.next = l1
        l1 = l1.next
    else:
        current.next = l2
        l2 = l2.next
    current = current.next
----

After the loop, at least one of the lists (`l1` or `l2`) has been fully traversed.
The remaining nodes from the other list are then appended to the new list.

[source,python,linenums]
----
current.next = l1 or l2
----

Finally, the function returns the merged list, excluding the dummy head node.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return dummy.next
----

This function effectively merges two sorted linked lists into a new sorted linked list, maintaining the original sort order.

===== Advantages

===== Disadvantages

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of the method_0 function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input linked lists, l1 and l2. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function will need to traverse both lists in their entirety.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(1).
This is because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the dummy and current nodes.
It does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input lists.
The new linked list is constructed using the nodes of the original lists, so no additional space is required for this.
=== Method 1:
==== Implementation

----
class ListNode:
    """
    Definition for singly-linked list.
    """
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def method_1(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    """Method 1: Recursive

    Parameters
    ----------
    l1 : ListNode
    l2 : ListNode

    Returns
    -------
    ListNode
    """
    if not l1:
        return l2
    elif not l2:
        return l1
    elif l1.val < l2.val:
        l1.next = method_1(l1.next, l2)
        return l1
    else:
        l2.next = method_1(l1, l2.next)
        return l2
----

==== Explanation

The provided code includes three methods for merging two sorted linked lists in Python.
The first method, `method_0`, has already been explained.
Let's move on to the second method, `method_1`.

`method_1` is a recursive solution to the problem.
It takes two parameters, `l1` and `l2`, which are instances of the `ListNode` class.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_1(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
----

The function starts by checking if either of the lists is empty (`None`).
If `l1` is `None`, it returns `l2`, and if `l2` is `None`, it returns `l1`.
This is because if one of the lists is empty, the result of the merge is simply the other list.

[source,python,linenums]
----
if not l1:
    return l2
elif not l2:
    return l1
----

If both lists are not empty, the function compares the values of the first nodes of `l1` and `l2`.
If the value of the first node of `l1` is smaller, it sets the `next` attribute of this node to the result of a recursive call to `method_1` with the next node of `l1` and `l2` as arguments.
It then returns the first node of `l1`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
elif l1.val < l2.val:
    l1.next = method_1(l1.next, l2)
    return l1
----

If the value of the first node of `l2` is smaller or equal, it does the same but with the roles of `l1` and `l2` reversed.

[source,python,linenums]
----
else:
    l2.next = method_1(l1, l2.next)
    return l2
----

This way, the function builds the merged list one node at a time, always choosing the node with the smaller value, and uses recursion to merge the rest of the lists.

The third method, `method_2`, is not implemented in the provided code.

===== Advantages

===== Disadvantages

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of the method_1 function is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input linked lists, l1 and l2. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function will need to traverse both lists in their entirety.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n + m).
This is due to the recursive nature of the function.
Each recursive call to method_1 adds a level to the call stack.
The maximum depth of the recursion is the length of the longer list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the lengths of the input lists.
=== Method 2:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
import heapq

class ListNode:
    """
    Definition for singly-linked list.
    """
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def method_2(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    """Method 2: Priority Queue

    Parameters
    ----------
    l1 : ListNode
    l2 : ListNode

    Returns
    -------
    ListNode
    """
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    queue = []

    while l1:
        heapq.heappush(queue, (l1.val, l1))
        l1 = l1.next

    while l2:
        heapq.heappush(queue, (l2.val, l2))
        l2 = l2.next

    while queue:
        val, node = heapq.heappop(queue)
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
        node = node.next
        if node:
            heapq.heappush(queue, (node.val, node))

    return dummy.next
----

==== Explanation

The provided code introduces a third method, `method_2`, for merging two sorted linked lists in Python.
This method uses a priority queue to sort the nodes from both lists.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_2(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
----

The function starts by creating a dummy node, `dummy`, and a pointer, `current`, that points to this dummy node.
The dummy node is used to keep track of the head of the new merged list.
It also initializes an empty list, `queue`, which will be used as the priority queue.

[source,python,linenums]
----
dummy = ListNode(0)
current = dummy
queue = []
----

The function then enters two separate loops to traverse `l1` and `l2`.
In each loop, it pushes each node from the list into the priority queue.
The `heapq.heappush` function is used to maintain the heap property of the queue.
The nodes are pushed as tuples, with the value of the node as the first element and the node itself as the second element.
This is because the `heapq` module sorts tuples by the first element.

[source,python,linenums]
----
while l1:
    heapq.heappush(queue, (l1.val, l1))
    l1 = l1.next

while l2:
    heapq.heappush(queue, (l2.val, l2))
    l2 = l2.next
----

After all nodes have been pushed into the queue, the function enters another loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty.
In each iteration, it pops the node with the smallest value from the queue and appends a new node with this value to the new list.
The `heapq.heappop` function is used to pop the node.

[source,python,linenums]
----
while queue:
    val, node = heapq.heappop(queue)
    current.next = ListNode(val)
    current = current.next
----

If the popped node has a next node, this next node is pushed into the queue.

[source,python,linenums]
----
node = node.next
if node:
    heapq.heappush(queue, (node.val, node))
----

Finally, the function returns the merged list, excluding the dummy head node.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return dummy.next
----

This method effectively merges two sorted linked lists into a new sorted linked list, maintaining the original sort order.
It uses a priority queue to always select the node with the smallest value from the two lists.

===== Advantages

===== Disadvantages

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of the method_2 function is O((n + m) log(n + m)), where n and m are the lengths of the two input linked lists, l1 and l2. This is because each insertion into a heap takes O(log n) time and we do this for each node in both lists.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n + m).
This is because in the worst-case scenario, all nodes from both lists could end up in the heap at the same time.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the total number of nodes.
