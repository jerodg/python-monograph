== Problem

[.lead]
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one *sorted* list.
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

=== Use-Cases

Merging two sorted lists is a common operation in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Analysis**: In data analysis, you might have two sorted lists representing two different datasets, and you want to merge them into a single sorted list for further analysis.

2. **Algorithm Design**: In algorithm design, particularly in sorting algorithms like merge sort, merging two sorted lists into one is a fundamental operation.

3. **Database Operations**: In database operations, merging two sorted lists can be analogous to performing a sorted UNION operation on two tables.

4. **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, you might have two sorted lists representing different feature sets, and you want to merge them to create a final sorted feature set for model training.

5. **Data Streaming**: In data streaming, you might receive sorted data from two different streams, and you want to merge them into a single sorted stream for real-time processing.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of merging two sorted lists can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
=== Constraints * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100` * Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in *non-decreasing* order.
== Examples === Example 0 image::img/image-2024-01-10-10-56-35-152.png[alt="Example 0"]

----
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
----

=== Example 1

----
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
----

=== Example 2

----
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
