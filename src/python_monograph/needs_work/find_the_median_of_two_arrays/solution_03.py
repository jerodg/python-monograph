def solution_03(nums: list[int], nums1: list[int]) -> float:
    """
    This function finds the median of two sorted arrays by merging them and then finding the middle value(s) using the brute
    force approach (alternate).

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The first sorted array.
        nums1 (list[int]): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two sorted arrays.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If both input arrays are empty.

    Approach:
        The function first checks if both input arrays are empty and raises a ValueError if they are.
        Then it merges the two sorted arrays into one and sorts it.
        If the total number of elements is odd, it returns the middle element.
        If the total number of elements is even, it calculates the average of the two middle elements as the median.

    Example:
        >>> solution_03([1, 3], [2])
        2.0
        >>> solution_03([1, 2], [3, 4])
        2.5
        >>> solution_03([0, 0], [0, 0])
        0.0
        >>> solution_03([], [])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ValueError: Both input arrays are empty.
        >>> solution_03([], [1])
        1.0
        >>> solution_03([-1000], [1000])
        0.0
        >>> solution_03([-1.1, -2.2], [-3.3, -4.4])
        -2.75

    if not nums and not nums1:
        raise ValueError('Both input arrays are empty.')

    # Merge the arrays into a single sorted array.
    merged = sorted(nums + nums1)
    total = len(merged)

    # the average of the two middle elements as the median.
