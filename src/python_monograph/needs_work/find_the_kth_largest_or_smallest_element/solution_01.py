def solution_01(nums: list, k: int, largest: bool = True) -> int:
    """This function finds the kth largest or smallest element in a given list of numbers using a heap.

    Parameters:
        nums (list): A list of integers. This is the list in which the function will search for the kth largest or smallest element.
        k (int): An integer that represents the position of the element to find.
        largest (bool): A boolean that indicates whether to find the kth largest or smallest element. It defaults to True,
            which means the function will find the kth largest element by default.

    Returns:
        int: The kth largest or smallest element in the list.

    The function uses a heap to keep track of the k largest or smallest elements seen so far. It iterates over the list,
    pushing each element onto the heap. If the size of the heap exceeds k, it pops the smallest element off the heap. This
    ensures that the heap always contains the k largest elements seen so far. At the end of the function, the smallest element on
    the heap is the kth largest element in the list.

    If the `largest` parameter is set to False, the function negates each element before pushing it onto the heap and after
    popping it off. This effectively turns the min-heap into a max-heap, allowing it to keep track of the k smallest elements
    instead of the k largest elements.
