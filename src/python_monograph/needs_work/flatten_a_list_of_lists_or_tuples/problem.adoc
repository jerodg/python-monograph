== Problem

[.lead]
You have a list of lists (or tuples) and you want to flatten it into a single list.

=== Use-Cases

Flattening a list of lists (or tuples) into a single list is a common operation in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In data preprocessing, you might have data organized in a nested structure (like a list of lists or tuples) and you want to flatten it for further processing or analysis.

2. **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, you might need to flatten a list of feature vectors (represented as lists or tuples) into a single list before feeding it into a machine learning model.

3. **Text Processing**: In text processing, you might have a list of sentences (where each sentence is a list of words) and you want to flatten it to perform word-level analysis.

4. **Graph Theory**: In graph theory, you might have a list of edges (where each edge is represented as a tuple of nodes) and you want to flatten it to get a list of all nodes in the graph.

5. **Image Processing**: In image processing, an image can be represented as a list of pixel rows (where each row is a list of pixels), and you might want to flatten it to perform pixel-level operations.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of flattening a list of lists or tuples into a single list can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
