def solution_04(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using a for loop and a conditional statement.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses a for loop to iterate over the input list. For each element in the list, it checks if the
        element is already in the unique list. If it's not, it appends the element to the unique list. This way, only
        the first occurrence of each element is kept in the list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_04([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

        if item not in unique:
