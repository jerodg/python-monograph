def solution_02(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using a set and list comprehension.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the set data structure to remove duplicates. The set data structure in Python
        does not allow duplicates, so when a list is converted to a set, all duplicates are automatically removed.
        The function then uses list comprehension to iterate over the original list and add each element to the set
        if it's not already present. The 'or' operator is used to return the element itself (since set.add() returns None).

    Example:
        >>> solution_02([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    """
    # Initialize an empty set to store unique elements
    unique = set()
    # Use list comprehension to iterate over the list
    # Add each element to the set if it's not already present
    # The 'or' operator is used to return the element itself (since set.add() returns None)
    return list([unique.add(n) or n for n in ls if n not in unique])
