def solution_05(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using list comprehension and enumerate.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses list comprehension and the enumerate function to remove duplicates. The enumerate function
        is used to get both the index and the value from the list. The value is then checked if it's in the list after
        the current index. If it's not, it's added to the new list. This way, only the last occurrence of each element
        is kept in the list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_05([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
