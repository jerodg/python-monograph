== Problem

[.lead]
Given an integer array `+nums+` sorted in *non-decreasing order*, remove the duplicates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[*in-place*] such that each unique element appears only *once*.
The *relative order* of the elements should be kept the *same*.
Then return _the number of unique elements in _`+nums+`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `+nums+` to be `+k+`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

* Change the array `+nums+` such that the first `+k+` elements of `+nums+` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `+nums+` initially.
The remaining elements of `+nums+` are not important as well as the size of `+nums+`.
* Return `+k+`.

*Custom Judge:*

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

....
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
....

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be *accepted*.

=== Approaches

To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place, you can consider the following techniques:

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: This technique involves maintaining two pointers: one for iterating over the array and the other for keeping track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.
As you iterate over the array, whenever you encounter a new unique element, you place it at the position indicated by the second pointer and then increment the second pointer.

2. **Counting Unique Elements**: Another approach is to first count the number of unique elements in the array.
This can be done by iterating over the array and keeping track of the current element.
If the next element is different from the current element, increment a counter.
The counter will then give the number of unique elements.

3. **Using a Set**: Although this approach does not strictly adhere to the in-place requirement, it can be used to solve a more general version of the problem where additional space is allowed.
You can iterate over the array and insert each element into a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
Then, you can copy the elements from the set back into the array.

Remember, the key to solving this problem efficiently is understanding the problem constraints (in this case, the in-place requirement and the fact that the array is already sorted) and choosing the right technique based on them.

=== Constraints

* `+1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10+`^`+4+`^
* `+-100 <= nums[i] <= 100+`
* `+nums+` is sorted in *non-decreasing* order.

== Use-Cases

The problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place is a common task in data processing and manipulation.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Cleaning**: In data analysis and machine learning, it's common to clean the data before processing it.
This could involve removing duplicate entries to ensure that the data is unique.

2. **Database Operations**: When dealing with databases, especially in operations like merging tables or records, duplicates might occur.
Removing these duplicates is essential to maintain the integrity of the data.

3. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: In SEO, it's important to avoid duplicate content on a website.
A tool that removes duplicates from a sorted list of webpage content or metadata can help improve a site's SEO.

4. **E-commerce Applications**: In e-commerce platforms, removing duplicates from a sorted list can be useful in various scenarios, such as removing duplicate product listings.

5. **Social Networking Applications**: In social networking applications, removing duplicates from a sorted list can be useful in scenarios like removing duplicate friend requests or posts.

Remember, these are just a few examples.
The need to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place can arise in many different contexts.

== Common Mistakes

When solving the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place, there are several common mistakes that you should avoid:

1. **Ignoring the In-Place Requirement**: One of the key constraints of this problem is that the solution must be in-place, meaning it should not allocate extra space for another array.
Using a separate array or data structure to store the unique elements is a common mistake.

2. **Not Maintaining the Relative Order**: The problem requires that the relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
It's a mistake to sort the array or rearrange the elements in a way that changes their original order.

3. **Not Handling Edge Cases**: Edge cases such as an empty array or an array with all identical elements should be handled correctly.
Ignoring these cases can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.

4. **Inefficient Use of Pointers**: In the two-pointer technique, it's important to correctly manage the pointers to ensure that each unique element is correctly placed in the array.
Mismanagement of pointers can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Returning the Wrong Value**: The problem requires returning the number of unique elements in the array.
Returning the modified array instead of the count of unique elements is a common mistake.

6. **Not Considering Time Complexity**: The problem should ideally be solved with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Solutions with higher time complexity may not be efficient for large inputs.

== Best Practices

When solving the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place, here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Make sure you fully understand the problem before you start coding.
This includes understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem.

2. **Choose the Right Approach**: Depending on the constraints of the problem, different approaches may be more suitable.
For example, if the problem requires an in-place solution, using a set or a separate array would not be appropriate.

3. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: When using pointers or counters, make sure to use descriptive variable names.
This will make your code easier to read and understand.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with all identical elements.
These cases can often lead to unexpected results if not handled correctly.

5. **Test Your Code**: After implementing your solution, make sure to test it with various test cases to ensure it works as expected.
This includes both the provided examples and any additional cases you can think of.

6. **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Always analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
This will help you understand the efficiency of your code and whether it can handle large inputs.

7. **Write Clean and Readable Code**: Make sure your code is clean, readable, and well-organized.
This includes using proper indentation, removing unnecessary comments or debug statements, and organizing your code in a logical way.

8. **Document Your Code**: It's a good practice to document your code, especially if it will be read by others.
This includes writing comments explaining what your code does and why you made certain decisions.

== Test Strategies

When testing the solution for the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place, you can consider the following strategies:

1. **Boundary Tests**: Test your solution with the minimum and maximum possible inputs.
For example, an array with only one element (minimum) and an array with the maximum number of elements as per the problem's constraints.

2. **Random Tests**: Generate random test cases within the problem's constraints to ensure your solution works for any input.

3. **Edge Cases**: Test your solution with edge cases.
For example, an array with all identical elements, an array with no duplicates, or an empty array.

4. **Large Inputs**: Test your solution with large inputs to ensure it can handle the maximum constraints and doesn't exceed time limits.

5. **Variety of Inputs**: Test your solution with a variety of inputs.
For example, an array with negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero.

6. **Performance Testing**: Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution and test it with large inputs to ensure it performs well.

7. **Regression Testing**: After making any changes or optimizations to your solution, re-run all the tests to ensure the changes didn't break anything.

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure your solution is correct, efficient, and robust against all possible inputs within the problem's constraints.

== Performance Optimizations

When optimizing the performance of a function that solves the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place, consider the following tips:

1. **Use the Two-Pointer Technique**: This technique is efficient for this problem as it only requires a single pass through the array.
One pointer is used to iterate over the array, and the other is used to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations**: Try to minimize the number of operations in your function.
For example, avoid unnecessary comparisons or assignments.

3. **Leverage the Sorted Property of the Array**: Since the array is sorted, you can simply compare the current element with the next one to check for duplicates.
This takes advantage of the sorted property and can significantly speed up the function.

4. **In-Place Modification**: As the problem requires an in-place solution, avoid creating new data structures which would increase space complexity and potentially slow down your function due to increased memory usage.

5. **Early Return**: If applicable, consider conditions under which you can return early from the function.
For example, if the array is empty or only contains one element, you can return immediately.

6. **Optimize for the Worst Case**: When optimizing, consider the worst-case scenario.
In this case, the worst scenario is when all elements are unique.
Ensure your solution is efficient even in this case.

Remember, always measure the performance of your function before and after making optimizations to ensure they are having the desired effect.
