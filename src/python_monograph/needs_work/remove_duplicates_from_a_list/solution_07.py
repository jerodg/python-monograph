def solution_07(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using the pandas library.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the pandas library to remove duplicates. It first converts the list to a pandas Series object,
        then uses the drop_duplicates() method to remove duplicates. The tolist() method is then used to convert the Series
        object back to a list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_07([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    """
    # Convert the list to a pandas Series object
    # Use the drop_duplicates() method to remove duplicates
    # Convert the Series object back to a list using the tolist() method
    return pd.Series(ls).drop_duplicates().tolist()
