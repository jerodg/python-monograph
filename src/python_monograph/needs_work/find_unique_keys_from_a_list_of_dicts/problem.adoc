== Problem

[.lead]
You need to find all the unique keys from a list of dicts.

=== Use-Cases

Finding all the unique keys from a list of dictionaries is a common task in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Analysis**: In data analysis, you might have a list of dictionaries representing a dataset, and you want to find all unique keys (attributes) in the dataset.
This can be useful in understanding the structure of the dataset.

2. **Data Transformation**: In data transformation, you might need to convert a list of dictionaries into another data structure (like a pandas DataFrame).
Knowing all unique keys can help in this transformation.

3. **Database Operations**: In database operations, a list of dictionaries can represent a table of data, with each dictionary being a row and keys being column names.
Finding all unique keys can help in understanding the schema of the table.

4. **JSON Parsing**: In JSON parsing, a list of dictionaries can represent a JSON array of objects.
Finding all unique keys can help in understanding the structure of the JSON data.

5. **Data Validation**: In data validation, you might need to check if all dictionaries in a list have the same keys or if there are any missing or extra keys in any dictionary.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of finding all the unique keys from a list of dictionaries can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
