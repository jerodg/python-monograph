def solution_01(nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Merges two sorted arrays in-place where the first array has enough space to hold the additional elements from the second array.

    This function uses the Two Pointers / Iteration Method (Start from the end). It involves using two pointers,
    each pointing to the end of each array. Compare the elements pointed by the pointers and put the larger one into
    the last unprocessed position in the result array, then move the pointer of the larger element one step backward.
    Repeat this process until all elements in both arrays have been processed.

    Args:
        nums1 (list[int]): The first sorted array, which has enough space to hold the additional elements from nums2.
        m (int): The number of initialized elements in nums1.
        nums2 (list[int]): The second sorted array.
        n (int): The number of initialized elements in nums2.

    Returns:
        None. The result is stored in nums1.

    Doctest:
        >>> nums1 = [4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]
        >>> m = 3
        >>> nums2 = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> n = 3
        >>> solution_01(nums1, m, nums2, n)
        >>> print(nums1)
