In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics[mathematics], a *monotonic function* (or *monotone function*) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)[function] between https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_order_structures_in_mathematics[ordered sets] that preserves or reverses the given https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_relation[order].^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function#cite_note-1[[1]]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function#cite_note-:1-2[[2]]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function#cite_note-:0-3[[3]]^ This concept first arose in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus[calculus], and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory[order theory].

An array is *monotonic* if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array `+nums+` is monotone increasing if for all `+i <= j+`, `+nums[i] <= nums[j]+`.
An array `+nums+` is monotone decreasing if for all `+i <= j+`, `+nums[i] >= nums[j]+`.

Given an integer array `+nums+`, return `+true+`_ if the given array is monotonic, or _`+false+`_ otherwise_.

=== Constraint(s)

* `+1 <= nums.length <= 10+`^`+5+`^
* `+-10+`^`+5+`^`+ <= nums[i] <= 10+`^`+5+`^

=== Example(s)

==== 0

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
nums = [1,2,2,3]
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
True
----

==== 1

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
nums = [6,5,4,4]
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
True
----

==== 2

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
nums = [1,3,2]
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
False

== Use-Case(s)

Here are some common use cases for checking if an array is monotonic:

1. **Data Analysis**: In data analysis, checking if an array is monotonic can be useful to understand trends in data.
For example, if a data set representing sales over time is monotonic increasing, it indicates consistent growth.

2. **Algorithm Optimization**: Some algorithms can be optimized if the input data is known to be monotonic.
For example, binary search can be simplified if the array is known to be monotonic.

3. **Signal Processing**: In signal processing, checking for monotonicity can help identify certain types of signals.
For example, a monotonic increasing signal might represent a steadily increasing frequency.

4. **Financial Mathematics**: In finance, checking for monotonicity can be useful in scenarios such as option pricing or risk management.
For example, a monotonic decreasing array of stock prices might trigger a sell signal.

5. **Physics and Engineering**: In fields like physics and engineering, checking for monotonicity can help in understanding the behavior of a system under certain conditions.
For example, a monotonic array might represent a system reaching a steady state.

== Common Mistakes

Here are some common mistakes to avoid when checking if an array is monotonic:

1. **Not Checking for Equal Elements**: A common mistake is to only check for strictly increasing or decreasing values.
However, an array can still be monotonic even if it has consecutive equal elements.
So, it's important to include equal elements in the check.

2. **Not Handling Edge Cases**: Edge cases such as an array with a single element or an empty array should also be considered.
These are technically monotonic as there are no elements violating the monotonicity.

3. **Inefficient Checking**: Checking each pair of elements in the array is inefficient and unnecessary.
It's enough to check each element with its next one, which reduces the time complexity.

4. **Not Returning Early**: If the array is not monotonic, you can return false as soon as you find a pair of elements that violate the condition.
There's no need to check the rest of the array.

5. **Ignoring the Direction**: It's important to determine the direction (increasing or decreasing) at the start.
A common mistake is to start checking the elements before knowing the direction, which can lead to incorrect results.

== Best Practices

Here are some best practices for checking if an array is monotonic:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Before you start coding, make sure you understand what a monotonic array is.
It's an array that is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

2. **Choose the Right Data Structure**: In this case, the array itself is the data structure.
There's no need for additional data structures.

3. **Use Built-in Functions Where Possible**: Python has built-in functions that can make your code cleaner and more efficient.
For example, the `all()` function can be used to check if all elements in a list are True.

4. **Write Clean Code**: Make sure your code is clean and easy to understand.
Use meaningful variable names, keep your functions small and avoid deep nesting.

5. **Comment Your Code**: Especially when dealing with mathematical problems like this, it's important to comment your code to explain what you're doing and why.

6. **Test Your Code**: Make sure to test your code with different cases, including edge cases like an empty array or an array with one element.

7. **Optimize Your Code**: The initial solution you come up with might not be the most efficient.
Always look for ways to optimize your code.
In this case, you can return False as soon as you find a pair of elements that violate the condition, instead of checking the entire array.

8. **Keep Learning**: Monotonicity is a concept from mathematics.
The more you learn about mathematics and how it applies to computer science, the better you'll become at solving these types of problems.

== Test Strategies

Here are some testing strategies for checking if an array is monotonic:

1. **Positive Testing**: Test with arrays that are known to be monotonic.
This includes arrays that are strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, and arrays with equal elements.

2. **Negative Testing**: Test with arrays that are known to not be monotonic.
This includes arrays that increase and then decrease, or decrease and then increase.

3. **Edge Cases**: Test with edge cases such as an empty array and an array with a single element.
These are technically monotonic, so the function should return true.

4. **Large Inputs**: Test with large arrays to ensure that the function can handle the maximum input size.
This can also help identify any performance issues.

5. **Random Inputs**: Test with random arrays to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios.
This can be done by generating random arrays of different sizes and checking the output of the function.

6. **Boundary Values**: Test with arrays that contain the minimum and maximum possible values.
This can help identify any issues with integer overflow or underflow.

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios, not just the ones that are most likely to occur.

== Performance Optimization

Here are some tips for optimizing the performance of a function that checks if an array is monotonic:

1. **Early Return**: If the array is not monotonic, you can return false as soon as you find a pair of elements that violate the condition.
There's no need to check the rest of the array.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Comparisons**: Instead of checking each pair of elements in the array, it's enough to check each element with its next one.
This reduces the number of comparisons and thus the time complexity.

3. **Use Built-in Functions**: Python has built-in functions that can make your code cleaner and more efficient.
For example, the `all()` function can be used to check if all elements in a list are True.

4. **Determine the Direction Early**: Determine whether the array is increasing or decreasing at the start.
This way, you only need to check the elements according to the determined direction, which can lead to fewer comparisons.

5. **Avoid Extra Space**: Try to avoid using extra space.
The problem can be solved in constant space complexity, so there's no need for additional data structures.

== Follow-up

For follow-up on checking if an array is monotonic, you could consider the following:

1. **Explore Other Languages**: Try implementing the same function in other programming languages.
This can help you understand the differences and similarities between languages.

2. **Parallel Processing**: If the array is extremely large, you might want to consider using parallel processing to speed up the check.
This could be an interesting way to learn about multithreading or multiprocessing in Python.

3. **Real World Application**: Try to find a real-world problem that requires checking if an array is monotonic.
This could be a problem from your work, from a coding challenge, or a problem you come up with yourself.

4. **Teaching Others**: Try explaining the problem, your solution, and the concept of monotonicity to someone else.
This is a great way to reinforce your own understanding.

5. **Further Reading**: Monotonicity is a concept from mathematics.
You might want to read more about it and other similar concepts.
This could help you in future coding problems.
