def find_all_permutations(lists: list[list[any]], index: int = 0) -> list[list[any]]:
    """
    Generate all possible permutations of the elements across all lists using backtracking.

    This function uses a recursive backtracking approach to generate all permutations. It starts with the first list and
    recursively generates permutations for the rest of the lists. It then inserts each element from the first list into
    all possible positions in each permutation of the rest of the lists.

    Args:
        lists (List[List[Any]]): A list of n lists.
        index (int): The current index in the list of lists. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        List[List[Any]]: A list of all possible permutations.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list of lists.

    Examples:
        >>> find_all_permutations([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2], [1, 4, 2, 3], [1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1], [2, 4,
        1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1], [3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 4, 2, 1], [4, 3, 1, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1]]
