    """Finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string using deque.

    This function uses a deque as a sliding window to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
    It iterates over the string, and for each character, it removes elements from the left of the deque until the deque does not
    contain the current character.
    Then it appends the current character to the deque. The maximum length of the deque during this process is the length of the
    longest substring without repeating characters.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        tuple[int, str]: A tuple containing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring
        itself.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_01('abcabcbb')
        (3, 'abc')

        >>> solution_01('bbbbbb')
        (1, 'b')

        >>> solution_01('pwwkew')
        (3, 'wke')
