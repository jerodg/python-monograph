def natural_sort(lst: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Sorts a list of strings in a way that is intuitive to humans using a bucket sort approach.

    Args:
        lst (List[str]): The list of strings to be sorted.

    Returns:
        List[str]: The sorted list of strings.

    Examples:
        >>> natural_sort(['file1.txt', 'file10.txt', 'file2.txt'])
        ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file10.txt']

        >>> natural_sort(['image99.png', 'image100.png', 'image101.png', 'image1.png', 'image10.png'])
        ['image1.png', 'image10.png', 'image99.png', 'image100.png', 'image101.png']

        >>> natural_sort(['version1.10', 'version1.2', 'version1.1'])

    Notes:
        This solution cannot handle a list of strings that are all the same.
