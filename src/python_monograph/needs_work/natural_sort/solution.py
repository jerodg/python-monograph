    """Perform a 'natural' sort on a list of strings.

    This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list that is sorted in natural order.
    Natural order sorting means that the numeric parts of the strings are sorted as numbers, not as strings.
    For example, the list ['file1', 'file10', 'file2'] is sorted as ['file1', 'file2', 'file10'] in natural order.
    The function uses recursion to sort nested lists.
    The original list is not modified.

    Args:
        x: The list of strings to be sorted.
        rvrs: A boolean value that determines whether the list should be sorted in reverse order. Default is False.

    Returns:
        A new list that contains all the elements from the input list, sorted in natural order.
