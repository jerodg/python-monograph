    """
    This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using a recursive approach.
    It iterates over the input list, removes each element, generates all permutations of the remaining list, and then appends the
    removed element to each of these permutations.

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of all permutations of the input list. Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_00([1, 2, 3])
        [[3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

    Note:
        The order of the permutations in the output list is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.
