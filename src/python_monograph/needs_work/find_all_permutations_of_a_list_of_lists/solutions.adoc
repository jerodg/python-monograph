== Solution(s)

[.lead]
=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `solution_00(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]` that generates all permutations of a given list of integers using a recursive approach.

The function starts by initializing an empty list `result` to store the permutations.
This is done with the line `result: list[list[int]] = []`.

The function then checks if the input list `nums` is empty.
If it is, the function returns a list containing an empty list.
This is the base case for the recursion.
This is done with the lines:

[source,python,linenums]
----
if len(nums) == 0:
    return [[]]
----

The function then enters a loop where it iterates over the input list.
In each iteration, it removes the first element from the list, recursively generates all permutations of the remaining list, and then appends the removed element to each of these permutations.
This is done with the lines:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for _ in range(len(nums)):
    n = nums.pop(0)
    permutations = solution_00(nums.copy())
    for perm in permutations:
        perm.append(n)
    result.extend(permutations)
    nums.append(n)
----

Here, `n = nums.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list and `permutations = solution_00(nums.copy())` recursively generates all permutations of the remaining list.
The removed element is then appended to each permutation with `perm.append(n)`, and the new permutations are added to the result list with `result.extend(permutations)`.
Finally, the removed element is added back to the end of the list with `nums.append(n)`.

At the end of the function, the list of all permutations is returned with `return result`.

In summary, this function uses a recursive approach to generate all permutations of a given list of integers.
It does this by removing each element from the list, generating all permutations of the remaining list, and then appending the removed element to each of these permutations.

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions are often simpler and more straightforward to understand than their iterative counterparts.
The base and recursive cases are clearly defined, which makes the code easier to read and understand.
2. **No need for auxiliary data structures**: Unlike some other methods that require the use of stacks or queues, this recursive approach does not require any additional data structures, which can simplify the implementation.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Stack Overflow**: Recursive solutions have the risk of stack overflow if the recursion depth becomes too large.
This is because each recursive call adds a layer to the system call stack.
If the list is very large, the system might run out of stack space, leading to a stack overflow error.
2. **Inefficiency**: The recursive approach can be inefficient for large lists.
This is because it involves a lot of repeated computation where the same subproblems are solved multiple times.
This redundancy increases the time complexity of the solution.
3. **Mutability**: The function mutates the input list in each recursive call with `nums.pop(0)` and `nums.append(n)`.
This could lead to unexpected side effects if the input list is used elsewhere in the program after the function call.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the selected code can be analyzed as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of generating all permutations of a list of `n` elements is `O(n!)`.
This is because there are `n!` (n factorial) possible permutations of a list of `n` elements, and the algorithm generates each permutation once.
The factorial function grows very rapidly with `n`, so the time complexity is exponential.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is also `O(n!)`.
This is because all `n!` permutations are stored in memory at the same time.
Each permutation is a list of `n` elements, but since the space complexity is measured in terms of the input size `n`, and not the size of the output, the space complexity is `O(n!)`.

It's worth noting that the actual memory usage might be higher due to the use of recursion.
Each recursive call adds a layer to the system call stack, and the maximum depth of the recursion is `n`.
Therefore, the space complexity could be considered as `O(n*n!)` in the worst case, taking into account the call stack.
However, typically when we talk about space complexity, we refer to the space needed to store the output, hence `O(n!)`.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code consists of two Python functions, `backtrack` and `solution_01`, which work together to generate all permutations of a given list of integers.

The `backtrack` function is a helper function that uses a recursive approach to generate the permutations.
It takes three arguments: `output`, `nums`, and `start`.
The `output` is a list that stores the permutations, `nums` is the input list of integers, and `start` is the index from which to begin generating permutations.

The function begins by checking if the `start` index is the last index of the list.
If it is, it appends a copy of the list to the `output` list.
This is the base case for the recursion.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python,linenums]
----
if start == len(nums) - 1:
    output.append(nums[:])
----

If the `start` index is not the last index, the function iterates over the list from the `start` index.
For each element, it swaps the `start` element with the current element, recursively generates all permutations of the remaining list, and then swaps the elements back to backtrack.
This is done using the following code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i in range(start, len(nums)):
    nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
    backtrack(output, nums, start + 1)
    nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
----

The `solution_01` function is the main function that generates all permutations of a given list of integers.
It takes one argument, `nums`, which is the input list of integers.
It initializes an empty list, `output`, to store the permutations and then calls the `backtrack` function to start generating permutations from the first index of the list.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python,linenums]
----
output: list[list[int]] = []
output = backtrack(output, nums, 0)
----

Finally, the `solution_01` function returns the `output` list, which now contains all permutations of the input list.
Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.

==== Advantages

1. **Completeness:** The backtracking algorithm ensures that all possible permutations are generated.
2. **In-Place:** The algorithm swaps elements in the original list, which means it does not require additional space for each permutation.
3. **Flexibility:** The algorithm can be easily modified to generate permutations in a specific order or to stop generating permutations once a certain condition is met.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency:** The backtracking algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), which means it can be slow for large lists.
2. **Recursion:** The algorithm uses recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow if the depth of recursion is too high (i.e., if the list is too large).
3. **Side Effects:** The algorithm modifies the original list during its execution, which can be a source of bugs if the original list is needed later in the program.

==== Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of generating all permutations of a list of `n` elements using a backtracking algorithm is `O(n!)`.
This is because there are `n!` (n factorial) possible permutations of a list of `n` elements, and each permutation is generated in `O(n)` time due to the list copying (`nums[:]`) in the base case of the recursion.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the code is `O(n*n!)`.
This is because all permutations are stored in memory at once.
Each permutation is a list of `n` elements, and there are `n!` permutations, so the total space required is proportional to `n * n!`.

NOTE: that this analysis assumes that the size of the input list `nums` is `n`.
If the size of the input list is not considered to be a constant, then the space complexity would be `O(n * n!)` because each permutation is a list of `n` elements.

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_02`.
This function is designed to generate all permutations of a given list of integers.
It uses Python's built-in `itertools.permutations` function to achieve this.

The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
The type hint `list[int]` is used to indicate this.
Here's the function signature:

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_02(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
----

Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to iterate over the result of the `itertools.permutations` function.
This function returns an iterable of tuples, where each tuple is a permutation of the input list.
The list comprehension converts each tuple to a list, as the requirement is to return a list of lists.
Here's the relevant line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
return [list(permutation) for permutation in permutations(nums)]
----

In the end, the function returns a list of all permutations of the input list, where each permutation is represented as a list of integers.
This is indicated by the return type hint `list[list[int]]`.

The function also includes a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, return value, and an example of its usage.
This is a common practice in Python to help other developers understand the purpose and usage of the function.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency:** The `itertools.permutations` function is implemented in C, making it faster than a pure Python implementation.
2. **Readability:** The use of list comprehension makes the code concise and easy to read.
3. **Standard Library:** Both `itertools.permutations` and list comprehension are part of Python's standard library, so no additional packages need to be installed.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Memory Usage:** The list comprehension creates a new list in memory.
If the input list is large, this could potentially use a significant amount of memory.
2. **Not In-Place:** The original tuples are not converted to lists in-place, meaning the original data structure is not modified.
This might not be desirable in some cases where memory usage is a concern.
3. **Limited Flexibility:** The `itertools.permutations` function generates all permutations of the input list, which might not be necessary in some cases.
There's no easy way to limit the number of permutations or to generate them in a specific order.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of generating all permutations of a list of `n` elements is `O(n!)`.
This is because there are `n!` (n factorial) possible permutations of a list of `n` elements, and the `itertools.permutations` function generates each permutation in constant time.

The space complexity of the code is also `O(n!)`.
This is because all permutations are stored in memory at once.
Each permutation is a list of `n` elements, and there are `n!` permutations, so the total space required is proportional to `n * n!`.
However, since `n` is a constant factor, it can be omitted from the space complexity, leaving us with `O(n!)`.

NOTE: that this analysis assumes that the size of the input list `nums` is `n`.
If the size of the input list is not considered to be a constant, then the space complexity would be `O(n * n!)` because each permutation is a list of `n` elements.

=== Solution 03

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_03.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_03`.
This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using an iterative approach.

The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
The type hint `list[int]` is used to indicate this.
Here's the function signature:

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_03(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
----

The function begins by initializing the `output` list with the input list as the first permutation.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
output = [nums]
----

Then, the function enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input list.
Inside this loop, a new `output` list is initialized for each iteration.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
new_output = []
----

Next, the function enters a nested loop that iterates over each permutation in the `output` list.
Inside this loop, another nested loop is used to iterate over each index in the permutation.
For each index, a new permutation is created by inserting the last element of the permutation at the current index.
This new permutation is then added to the `new_output` list.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i in range(len(perm)):
    new_perm = perm[:i] + [perm[-1]] + perm[i:-1]
    new_output.append(new_perm)
----

After all permutations have been generated for the current iteration, the `output` list is updated with the `new_output` list.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
output = new_output
----

Finally, after all iterations have been completed, the function returns the `output` list, which now contains all permutations of the input list.
Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.
This is indicated by the return type hint `list[list[int]]`.

The function also includes a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, return value, and an example of its usage.
This is a common practice in Python to help other developers understand the purpose and usage of the function.

==== Advantages

1. **In-Place:** The algorithm generates permutations in-place, which means it does not require additional space for each permutation.
2. **Iterative:** The algorithm uses an iterative approach, which avoids the potential for stack overflow that can occur with recursive solutions.
3. **Flexibility:** The algorithm can be easily modified to generate permutations in a specific order or to stop generating permutations once a certain condition is met.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency:** The iterative algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), which means it can be slow for large lists.
2. **Memory Usage:** The algorithm stores all permutations in memory at once, which can be a concern for large lists due to high memory usage.
3. **Complexity:** The algorithm involves multiple nested loops, which can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the selected code can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of generating all permutations of a list of `n` elements using an iterative approach is `O(n!)`.
This is because there are `n!` (n factorial) possible permutations of a list of `n` elements, and each permutation is generated in `O(n)` time due to the list slicing and concatenation operations.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the code is `O(n*n!)`.
This is because all permutations are stored in memory at once.
Each permutation is a list of `n` elements, and there are `n!` permutations, so the total space required is proportional to `n * n!`.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input list `nums` is `n`.
If the size of the input list is not considered to be a constant, then the space complexity would be `O(n * n!)` because each permutation is a list of `n` elements.

=== Solution 04

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_04.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_04`.
This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using a stack-based approach.

The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
The type hint `list[int]` is used to indicate this.
Here's the function signature:

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_04(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
----

The function begins by initializing a stack with the input list and an empty permutation.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
stack = [(nums, [])]
----

Then, the function initializes the `output` list, which will store all the permutations.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
output = []
----

Next, the function enters a loop that continues as long as the stack is not empty.
Inside this loop, a list and a permutation are popped from the stack.
If the list is empty, the permutation is added to the `output` list.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
nums, perm = stack.pop()
if not nums:
    output.append(perm)
----

If the list is not empty, the function enters a loop that iterates over each number in the list.
Inside this loop, a new list (with the current number removed) and a new permutation (with the current number added) are pushed to the stack.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i in range(len(nums)):
    stack.append((nums[:i] + nums[i + 1 :], perm + [nums[i]]))
----

Finally, after all permutations have been generated, the function returns the `output` list, which now contains all permutations of the input list.
Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.
This is indicated by the return type hint `list[list[int]]`.

The function also includes a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, return value, and an example of its usage.
This is a common practice in Python to help other developers understand the purpose and usage of the function.

1. **Non-Recursive:** The stack-based approach is non-recursive, which avoids the potential for stack overflow that can occur with recursive solutions.
2. **Space Efficient:** The algorithm generates permutations in-place, which means it does not require additional space for each permutation.
3. **Flexibility:** The algorithm can be easily modified to generate permutations in a specific order or to stop generating permutations once a certain condition is met.

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_05.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_05`.
This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using a queue-based approach.

The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
The type hint `list[int]` is used to indicate this.
Here's the function signature:

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_05(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
----

The function begins by initializing a queue with the input list and an empty permutation.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
queue = deque([(nums, [])])
----

Then, the function initializes the `output` list, which will store all the permutations.
This is done using the following line of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
output = []
----

Next, the function enters a loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty.
Inside this loop, a list and a permutation are dequeued from the queue.
If the list is empty, the permutation is added to the `output` list.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
nums, perm = queue.popleft()
if not nums:
    output.append(perm)
----

If the list is not empty, the function enters a loop that iterates over each number in the list.
Inside this loop, a new list (with the current number removed) and a new permutation (with the current number added) are enqueued to the queue.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i in range(len(nums)):
    queue.append((nums[:i] + nums[i + 1 :], perm + [nums[i]]))
----

Finally, after all permutations have been generated, the function returns the `output` list, which now contains all permutations of the input list.
Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.
This is indicated by the return type hint `list[list[int]]`.

The function also includes a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, return value, and an example of its usage.
