    This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using Python's built-in itertools.permutations function.

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of all permutations of the input list. Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_02([1, 2, 3])
        [(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
