def calculate_product_sum(arr: list[int | list], depth: int = 1) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the product sum of a nested array using a recursive method.

    The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements multiplied by their respective depths. If an
    element is a list, its product sum is calculated recursively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its
    depth plus one.

    Args:
        arr (list[int | list]): A list that can contain integers or other nested lists.
        depth (int, optional): The initial depth of the array. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        int: The product sum of the array.

    Examples:
        >>> calculate_product_sum([5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]])
        27
        >>> calculate_product_sum([1, [2, [3, [4, [5]]]]])
        105
        >>> calculate_product_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        15
        >>> calculate_product_sum([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
        42
        >>> calculate_product_sum([1, [2, 3, [4, 5], 6, 7], 8])
