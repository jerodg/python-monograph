def solution_03(nums: list) -> list[list[int]]:
    """This function finds all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero using a hashing technique.

    Parameters:
        nums (list): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of lists where each list contains three integers that sum up to zero.

    Approach:
    The function creates a hash table for storing the frequency of each element in the array. Then, for each pair of elements,
    it checks if the negative of their sum exists in the hash table. If it does, then it has found a triplet that sums to zero.
