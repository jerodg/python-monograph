def solution_00(nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
    """This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers
    whose sum is zero. The function uses the combinations function from the itertools module to generate all possible
    combinations of three integers from the input list. It then filters out the combinations whose sum is not zero.
    The function finally returns the filtered combinations as a list of lists.

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of lists where each sublist contains three integers whose sum is zero.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_00([-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4])
            [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

            []
        >>> solution_00([0, 0, 0])
