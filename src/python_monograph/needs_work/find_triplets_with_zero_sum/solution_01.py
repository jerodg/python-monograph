    """This function finds all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

    Parameters:
        nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of lists where each list contains three integers that sum up to zero.

    Approach:
        The function sorts the input list and then iterates over it. For each number, it uses a two-pointer technique
        to find a pair in the rest of the list that sums up to the negative of the current number, thus ensuring that
        the three numbers sum up to zero. It also handles duplicates by skipping over the same numbers.
