    """
    This function removes duplicates from a sorted list in Python using the itertools.groupby() method.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the itertools.groupby() method to remove duplicates. The groupby() method groups consecutive
        elements in the list that are the same. The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the groups and
        select the first element from each group (which is done using the next() function). This way, only the first occurrence
        of each element is kept in the list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_09([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    return [next(g) for _, g in itertools.groupby(sorted(ls, key=operator.itemgetter(0))) if g]
