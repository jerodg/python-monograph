def solution_00(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the set data structure to remove duplicates. The set data structure in Python
        does not allow duplicates, so when a list is converted to a set, all duplicates are automatically removed.
        However, sets are unordered, so the original order of elements in the list is not preserved.

    Example:
        >>> solution_00([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    """
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    # Then convert the set back to a list
    return list(set(ls))
