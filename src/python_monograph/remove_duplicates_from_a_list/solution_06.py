def solution_06(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using the dict.fromkeys() method.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the dict.fromkeys() method to remove duplicates. The dict.fromkeys() method creates a new
        dictionary with the elements of the list as keys and None as their values. Since a dictionary cannot have duplicate
        keys, this method effectively removes duplicates from the list. The function then converts the keys of the dictionary
        back to a list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_06([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
