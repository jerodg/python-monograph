def solution_01(ls: list) -> list:
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list in Python using a set and list unpacking.

    Args:
        ls (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed.

    Note:
        This function uses the set data structure to remove duplicates. The set data structure in Python
        does not allow duplicates, so when a list is converted to a set, all duplicates are automatically removed.
        However, sets are unordered, so the original order of elements in the list is not preserved.
        The function then uses list unpacking to convert the set back to a list.

    Example:
        >>> solution_01([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    """
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    # Then use list unpacking to convert the set back to a list
