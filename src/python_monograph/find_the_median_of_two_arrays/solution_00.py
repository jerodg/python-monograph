def solution_00(nums: List[int], nums1: List[int]) -> float:
    """This function finds the median of two sorted arrays using the brute force approach.

    Args:
        nums (list): The first sorted array.
        nums1 (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two sorted arrays.

    Approach:
        The function merges the two sorted arrays into a new list and sorts it.
        Then it checks if the length of the merged list is odd or even.
        If it's odd, it returns the middle element.
        If it's even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.

    Example:
        >>> solution_00([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
        3.5
        >>> solution_00([1, 2], [3, 4])
        2.5
