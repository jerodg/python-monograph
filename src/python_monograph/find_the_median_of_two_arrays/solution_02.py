def solution_02(nums: List[int], nums1: List[int]) -> float:
    """This function finds the median of two sorted arrays using the two pointers method.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The first sorted array.
        nums1 (List[int]): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two sorted arrays.

    Approach:
        The function uses two pointers to merge the two sorted arrays into one.
        Then it calculates the median based on the length of the merged array.

    Example:
        >>> solution_02([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
        3.5
        >>> solution_02([1, 2], [3, 4])
        2.5
