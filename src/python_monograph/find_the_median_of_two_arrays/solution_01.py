def solution_01(nums: List[int], nums1: List[int]) -> float:
    """This function finds the median of two sorted arrays using the binary search method.

    Args:
        nums (list): The first sorted array.
        nums1 (list): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two sorted arrays.

    Approach:
        The function first ensures that `nums1` is the smaller array.
        Then it performs a binary search on `nums1` and calculates the median based on the elements at the partition points.

    Example:
        >>> solution_01([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
        3.5
        >>> solution_01([1, 2], [3, 4])
        2.5
