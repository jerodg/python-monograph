class DataSize:
    """
    A class used to represent a Data Size.

    This class takes a size in bytes and a notation, and provides a method to calculate and return a string representing the size
    in the appropriate notation.

    Attributes:
        size (int): The size in bytes.
        notation (str): The notation to use for the size calculation.
        suffixes (dict): A dictionary mapping notations to their corresponding suffixes.
        bases (dict): A dictionary mapping notations to their corresponding bases.

    Methods:
        calculate_data_size(): Calculates the size in the appropriate notation and returns it as a string.

    Doctest:
        >>> ds = DataSize(1500, 'decimal')
        >>> ds.calculate_product_sum()
        '1.5 KB'
        >>> ds = DataSize(1500, 'binary')
        >>> ds.calculate_product_sum()
        '1.465 KiB'
        >>> ds = DataSize(1500, 'bits')
        >>> ds.calculate_product_sum()
        '12 Kb'
        >>> ds = DataSize(1500, 'nibbles')
        >>> ds.calculate_product_sum()
        '3 Kn'
        >>> ds = DataSize(1024, 'binary')
        >>> ds.calculate_product_sum()
        '1 KiB'

    def calculate_data_size(self) -> str:
        """
        Calculates the size in the appropriate notation and returns it as a string using an object-oriented approach.

        This method first determines the base for the calculation based on the notation.
        If the notation is 'bits', it converts the size from bytes to bits by multiplying by 8.
        If the notation is 'nibbles', it converts the size from bytes to nibbles by multiplying by 2.
        It then divides the size by the base until the size is less than the base or it has gone through all the suffixes for the
        notation.
        Finally, it formats the size as a string with 3 decimal places, removes trailing zeros and the decimal point if it's at
        the end, and returns the size with the appropriate suffix.

        Returns:
            str: A string representing the size in the appropriate notation.

        Examples:
            >>> calculator = DataSize(1500, 'decimal')
            >>> calculator.calculate_product_sum()
            '1.5 KB'
