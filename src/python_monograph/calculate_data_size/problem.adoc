:description: Calculate Data Size Problem
:keywords: problem, python

== {description}

[.lead]
In the world of computing, data size is a critical aspect that often needs to be understood and managed.
Data can be represented in various units such as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and so on.
These units can be represented in two different notations - decimal and binary.
The task is to write a Python function, calculate_data_size(size: int, notation: str = 'decimal') -> str, that takes in a size in bytes and a notation ('decimal' or 'binary'), and returns a string representing the size in the appropriate notation.
The function should raise a ValueError if the size is negative or if the notation is not 'decimal' or 'binary'.

*Decimal* units are defined by SI(International System of Units), use Metric prefixes such as kilo, mega etc.
Decimal units are multiples of 1000.

*Binary* units are comparatively newer, defined by IEC(International Electro technical Commission), prefixed with kibi, mebi etc. evaluated as multiples of 1024. You can find further details on each units below.

https://www.dataunitconverter.com/bit[Bit]

Digital storage units come in all shapes and sizes, from the smallest byte to the massive yottabyte.
It is also essential to know about the difference between Decimal and Binary units and how those are related to each other.
Understanding these units and their corresponding storage capacities is crucial for selecting the right storage device for your needs.
Whether you're storing personal files or managing enterprise-level data, it's important to consider the amount of storage you'll require and choose a storage device that meets your needs.

== Constraints

The constraints for the problem could be as follows:

1. The `size` parameter is an integer and can range from 0 to 10^18. This represents the size in bytes.

2. The `notation` parameter is a string and can only be 'decimal', 'binary', 'bits', or 'nibbles'.
This represents the notation to use for the size calculation.

3. The function should raise a ValueError if the size is negative.
This is to ensure that the size is always a positive value.

4. The function should also raise a ValueError if the notation is not 'decimal', 'binary', 'bits', or 'nibbles'.
This is to ensure that the notation is always one of the four valid options.

5. The function should return a string representing the size in the appropriate notation.
The string should be formatted as a number with 2 decimal places, followed by the appropriate suffix.

For example, if the size is 1024 and the notation is 'decimal', the function should return '1.02 KB'.
If the size is 1024 and the notation is 'binary', the function should return '1.00 KiB'.

== Use-Cases

The `calculate_data_size` function can be used in a variety of real-world scenarios where understanding and managing data size is crucial.
Here are a few examples:

1. **File Management Systems:** In file management systems, it's common to display the size of files or folders to the user.
The `calculate_data_size` function can be used to convert the size from bytes (which is how it's typically stored in the system) to a more user-friendly format like kilobytes, megabytes, etc.

2. **Storage Management:** In storage devices like hard drives or SSDs, the total space and the used space are often represented in larger units like GB or TB.
This function can be used to calculate and display these sizes in a consistent manner.

3. **Network Traffic Monitoring:** In network traffic monitoring, the amount of data sent and received is often tracked.
This function can be used to convert the raw byte counts into a more understandable format.

4. **System Performance Monitoring:** In system performance monitoring, various metrics like memory usage, disk usage, etc., are tracked.
These metrics are often in bytes and can be converted to a more readable format using this function.

5. **Data Transfer:** When transferring data over a network, it's often useful to know the size of the data being transferred.
This function can be used to calculate and display the size of the data in a user-friendly format.

6. **Cloud Storage Services:** Cloud storage services often provide users with a dashboard that displays their usage statistics, including how much storage they're using.
This function can be used to calculate and display these statistics in a format that's easy for users to understand.

== Common Mistakes

When solving this problem, there are several common mistakes that developers often make:

1. **Not Handling Negative Sizes:** One common mistake is not handling negative sizes.
In this problem, the size should always be a positive integer.
If a negative size is passed to the function, it should raise a ValueError.

2. **Not Handling Invalid Notations:** Another common mistake is not handling invalid notations.
The notation should always be one of 'decimal', 'binary', 'bits', or 'nibbles'.
If an invalid notation is passed to the function, it should raise a ValueError.

3. **Incorrect Conversion Between Units:** It's also common to make mistakes when converting between different units of measurement.
For example, there are 8 bits in a byte and 2 nibbles in a byte, not the other way around.
Make sure to use the correct conversion factors when converting between different units.

4. **Not Formatting the Output Correctly:** The function should return a string representing the size in the appropriate notation, formatted as a number with 2 decimal places, followed by the appropriate suffix.
It's easy to forget to format the output correctly, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Not Considering Large Sizes:** When dealing with large sizes, it's important to ensure that the function can handle them correctly.
For example, if the size is larger than the largest suffix in the list, the function should still be able to return a correct result.

6. **Not Testing the Function Thoroughly:** Finally, it's important to test the function thoroughly with a variety of different inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
This includes testing with different sizes, different notations, and edge cases like negative sizes and invalid notations.

== Best Practices

When solving this problem, you can follow these best practices:

1. **Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names:** The names of your variables and functions should clearly describe what they represent or do.
This makes your code easier to read and understand.

2. **Handle Edge Cases:** Make sure to handle edge cases, such as negative sizes and invalid notations.
This will make your function more robust and reliable.

3. **Use Constants for Repeated Values:** If a value is used multiple times in your code (like the base values 1000 and 1024), consider defining it as a constant at the top of your code.
This makes your code easier to maintain, as you only need to change the value in one place if it needs to be updated.

4. **Use Docstrings:** Include a docstring at the beginning of your function to explain what the function does, its parameters, its return value, and any exceptions it raises.
This is not only helpful for others reading your code, but also for you if you need to revisit your code in the future.

5. **Keep Functions Small and Focused:** Each function should do one thing and do it well.
If your function is doing multiple things, consider breaking it up into smaller, more focused functions.
This makes your code easier to read, test, and debug.

6. **Use Type Hints:** Type hints help make your code more readable and self-documenting.
They also allow tools to provide better support when writing and refactoring code.

7. **Test Your Code:** Write tests for your function to make sure it works as expected.
This includes tests for normal cases, edge cases, and error cases.
Testing helps you catch bugs and makes sure your code continues to work correctly as you make changes.

8. **Follow PEP 8 Style Guide:** PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code.
Following it makes your code more readable and consistent with the majority of Python code out there.
