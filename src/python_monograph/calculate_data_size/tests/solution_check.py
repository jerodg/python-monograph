#     Calculates the total data size of a nested array using ast.literal_eval()
#
#     This function takes a nested list as input and returns the total data size. The data size of an array is defined
#     as the sum of its elements. If an element is a list, its data size is calculated recursively by summing the sizes
#     of its elements.

#     Args:
#         arr (list[int | list]): A list that can contain integers or other nested lists.
#
#     Returns:
#         int: The total data size of the array.
#
#     Examples:
#         >>> calculate_product_sum([1, 2, 3])
#         6
#         >>> calculate_product_sum([1, 2, [3, 4]])
