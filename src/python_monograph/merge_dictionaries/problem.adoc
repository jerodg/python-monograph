== Problem

[.lead]
You need to merge one or more dictionaries.

=== Use-Cases

Merging one or more dictionaries is a common task in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Aggregation**: In data aggregation, you might have multiple dictionaries representing different data sources, and you want to merge them into a single dictionary for further processing or analysis.

2. **Configuration Management**: In configuration management, you might have multiple dictionaries representing different configuration files, and you want to merge them to create a final configuration.

3. **Web Development**: In web development, especially in backend development, you might have multiple dictionaries representing different parts of a request (like headers, query parameters, and body), and you want to merge them for processing.

4. **Data Transformation**: In data transformation, you might need to merge multiple dictionaries into one to transform the data structure for a specific requirement.

5. **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, you might have multiple dictionaries representing different feature sets, and you want to merge them to create a final feature set for model training.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of merging one or more dictionaries can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
