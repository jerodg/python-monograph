=== Method 0:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_0(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Copy->Update

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    temp = x.copy()
    temp.update(y)
    return temp
----

==== Explanation

The provided code is a Python function named `method_0` that merges two dictionaries.
It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function begins by creating a copy of the first dictionary `x` using the `copy` method.
This is done to avoid modifying the original dictionary.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
temp = x.copy()
----

Next, the function updates this copied dictionary with the contents of the second dictionary `y` using the `update` method.
The `update` method adds elements to the dictionary if the key is not in the dictionary.
If the key is in the dictionary, it updates the key with the new value.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
temp.update(y)
----

Finally, the function returns the updated dictionary `temp`, which now contains the merged contents of both input dictionaries.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
return temp
----

In summary, `method_0` is a simple and straightforward way to merge two dictionaries in Python.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries, with values from the second dictionary overwriting those from the first in case of duplicate keys.

===== Advantages

1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python dictionary methods, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The `copy` method creates a new dictionary, which means the original dictionaries are not modified during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** The `update` method overwrites the value of duplicate keys with the value from the second dictionary.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Memory Usage:** The `copy` method creates a new dictionary, which can lead to increased memory usage, especially for large dictionaries.
This might not be the most efficient method if memory usage is a concern.

2. **In-place Modification:** The `update` method modifies the dictionary in-place.
While this is not an issue in this specific implementation because a copy of the dictionary is made, it's something to be aware of when using `update` in other contexts.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** The `update` method overwrites the value of duplicate keys with the value from the second dictionary.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the copy method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dictionary.
This is because each element in the dictionary needs to be copied to the new dictionary.
The update method also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because each key-value pair in the second dictionary needs to be inserted into the first dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.

def method_1(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Add Items

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    return dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items()))
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_1` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function begins by converting each dictionary into a list of its items using the `items` method.
This method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
list(x.items()) + list(y.items())
----

Next, these two lists are concatenated using the `+` operator.
This results in a new list that contains the items from both dictionaries.

Finally, this list of items is converted back into a dictionary using the `dict` function.
This function creates a new dictionary from an iterable of key-value pairs.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
return dict(...)
----

In summary, `method_1` is a simple way to merge two dictionaries in Python.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python dictionary and list methods, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The `items` method does not modify the original dictionaries during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Memory Usage:** The `items` method and list concatenation create new lists and a new dictionary, which can lead to increased memory usage, especially for large dictionaries.
This might not be the most efficient method if memory usage is a concern.

2. **Performance:** Converting dictionaries to lists and back to a dictionary is a relatively expensive operation in terms of computational resources.
This method might not be the most efficient if performance is a concern.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the items method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dictionary.
This is because each element in the dictionary needs to be converted into a tuple and added to the list.
The list concatenation operation also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two lists.
This is because each element in the lists needs to be copied to the new list.
Finally, the dict function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because each tuple in the list needs to be converted into a key-value pair in the new dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n + m + p), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary, m is the number of elements in the second dictionary, and p is the total number of elements in the two lists.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new list and a new dictionary are created to store the merged result.
The space required for these new data structures is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.

def method_2(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Curly Star
        - Requires Python 3.5+

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    return {**x, **y}
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_2` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses a feature introduced in Python 3.5, known as dictionary unpacking or the "curly star" method.
This feature allows you to merge dictionaries by unpacking the key-value pairs from each dictionary into a new dictionary.
Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
{**x, **y}
----

In this snippet, the `**` operator is used to unpack the key-value pairs from the dictionaries `x` and `y`.
The key-value pairs from `y` will overwrite the ones from `x` in case of duplicate keys.

In summary, `method_2` is a concise and efficient way to merge two dictionaries in Python.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses a built-in Python feature, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **Efficiency:** This method is generally faster than other methods of merging dictionaries, especially for large dictionaries.

3. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The dictionary unpacking method does not modify the original dictionaries during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.

4. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Python Version:** This method was introduced in Python 3.5. Therefore, it is not available in earlier versions of Python.

2. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the dictionary unpacking operation is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two dictionaries.
This is because each key-value pair in the dictionaries needs to be inserted into the new dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
==== Tests === Method 3:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_3(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Chain Map

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    return dict(ChainMap({}, y, x))
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_3` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses the `ChainMap` class from the `collections` module. `ChainMap` is a class that provides the ability to link multiple mappings together such that they end up being a single unit.
If there are duplicate keys, then only the value from the first dictionary is preserved.
In the context of this function, the `ChainMap` class is used to link the dictionaries `y` and `x` together.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
ChainMap({}, y, x)
----

In this snippet, an empty dictionary is first provided to the `ChainMap` function, followed by the dictionaries `y` and `x`.
The empty dictionary is used as a placeholder to ensure that the original dictionaries `x` and `y` are not modified, as `ChainMap` would modify the first dictionary provided in case of duplicate keys.

Finally, the `dict` function is used to convert the `ChainMap` object back into a dictionary.
This is done because `ChainMap` returns a view on the original dictionaries, but the requirement here is to get a new dictionary.

In summary, `method_3` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using the `ChainMap` class.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the first dictionary is preserved.
===== Advantages 1. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The `ChainMap` method does not modify the original dictionaries during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.

2. **Efficiency:** `ChainMap` is generally more memory efficient than other methods of merging dictionaries, especially for large dictionaries, as it does not create a new dictionary but rather a view on the original dictionaries.

3. **Preservation of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the first dictionary is preserved.
This is useful when you want the first dictionary's values to take precedence over the second's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Return Type:** `ChainMap` returns a view on the original dictionaries, not a new dictionary.
If you need a new dictionary, you have to convert the `ChainMap` object back into a dictionary, which adds an extra step and can be less efficient.

2. **Order of Dictionaries:** The order in which the dictionaries are provided to `ChainMap` matters.
The values from the first dictionary will take precedence over the second in case of duplicate keys.
This might not be what you want in some cases.

3. **Access to Values:** Accessing values in a `ChainMap` can be slower than in a regular dictionary, especially if there are many dictionaries in the `ChainMap`, as it has to search each dictionary in order.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of creating a ChainMap is O(1), as it simply creates a view on the original dictionaries without copying them.
However, converting the ChainMap back into a dictionary using the dict function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two dictionaries.
This is because each key-value pair in the dictionaries needs to be inserted into the new dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
However, it's worth noting that the ChainMap itself is more memory efficient than creating a new dictionary, as it does not copy the key-value pairs but instead creates a view on the original dictionaries.
The additional space required for the ChainMap is O(m), where m is the number of dictionaries in the ChainMap, which in this case is constant.
==== Tests === Method 4:

def method_4(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Itertools Chain

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    return dict(chain(x.items(), y.items()))
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_4` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses the `chain` function from the `itertools` module. `chain` is a function that takes several iterables as arguments and returns a single iterable that combines all of them.
In the context of this function, `chain` is used to combine the items of the dictionaries `x` and `y`.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
chain(x.items(), y.items())
----

In this snippet, `x.items()` and `y.items()` are passed to `chain`.
The `items` method of a dictionary returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
So, `chain` combines these two lists of key-value pairs into a single iterable.

Finally, the `dict` function is used to convert this iterable back into a dictionary.
This is done because the requirement here is to get a new dictionary, not an iterable.

In summary, `method_4` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using the `chain` function from the `itertools` module.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary is preserved.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **Efficiency:** The `chain` function is generally more efficient than other methods of merging dictionaries, especially for large dictionaries, as it does not create a new dictionary but rather a single iterable that combines the items of the input dictionaries.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Return Type:** The `chain` function returns an iterable, not a new dictionary.
If you need a new dictionary, you have to convert the iterable back into a dictionary, which adds an extra step and can be less efficient.

2. **Memory Usage:** The `chain` function creates a new iterable, which can lead to increased memory usage, especially for large dictionaries.
This might not be the most efficient method if memory usage is a concern.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the chain function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two dictionaries.
This is because chain creates a new iterable that combines the items of the input dictionaries.
Converting this iterable back into a dictionary using the dict function also has a time complexity of O(n), as each item in the iterable needs to be inserted into the new dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new iterable and a new dictionary are created to store the merged result.
The space required for these new data structures is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.

    """
    return x | y
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_5` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses the dictionary union operator `|`, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.9. This operator merges two dictionaries into a new one.
If there are duplicate keys, the values from the second dictionary will overwrite the values from the first.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
return x | y
----

In this snippet, `x` and `y` are the input dictionaries.
The `|` operator is used to merge them into a new dictionary, which is then returned by the function.

In summary, `method_5` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using the dictionary union operator.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary is preserved.
This method is simple and efficient, but it requires Python 3.9 or later.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses a built-in Python operator, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **Efficiency:** The dictionary union operator is generally more efficient than other methods of merging dictionaries, especially for large dictionaries, as it does not create a new dictionary but rather a single dictionary that combines the items of the input dictionaries.

===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the dictionary union operator | is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two dictionaries.
This is because the operator creates a new dictionary that combines the items of the input dictionaries.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.

    return next(z.update(y) or z for z in [x.copy()])
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_6` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses the `next` function and a generator expression to achieve this.
A generator expression is a high performance, memory efficient generalization of list comprehensions and generators.
In a generator expression, the output is not stored in memory, but is generated on the fly.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
next(z.update(y) or z for z in [x.copy()])
----

In this snippet, `x.copy()` creates a copy of the first dictionary.
This copy is then updated with the items from the second dictionary `y` using the `update` method.
The `update` method modifies the dictionary in-place and returns `None`, so the `or` operator is used to return the updated dictionary `z` instead.
The `next` function is used to retrieve the first item generated by the generator expression, which is the merged dictionary.

In summary, `method_6` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using a generator expression and the `next` function.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary is preserved.
This method is efficient in terms of memory usage, but it may be less intuitive than other methods due to the use of a generator expression.
===== Advantages 1. **Efficiency:** This method is efficient in terms of memory usage.
The generator expression generates the output on the fly and does not store it in memory, which can be beneficial for large dictionaries.

2. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.

3. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The `copy` method creates a new dictionary, which means the original dictionaries are not modified during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** This method uses a generator expression and the `next` function, which may be less intuitive for developers who are not familiar with these concepts.

2. **Single Use:** The generator expression is a single-use iterator.
This means that once the items have been generated and used, they cannot be reused.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the copy method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary.
This is because each element in the dictionary needs to be copied to the new dictionary.
The update method also has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because each key-value pair in the second dictionary needs to be inserted into the first dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
However, it's worth noting that the generator expression itself does not consume additional space as it generates the output on the fly.

    return (lambda z: z.update(y) or z)(x.copy())
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_7` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses a lambda function to achieve this.
A lambda function is a small anonymous function that is defined with the `lambda` keyword in Python.
It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
(lambda z: z.update(y) or z)(x.copy())
----

In this snippet, `x.copy()` creates a copy of the first dictionary.
This copy is then passed as an argument to the lambda function.
The lambda function takes one argument `z`, updates `z` with the items from the second dictionary `y` using the `update` method, and then returns `z`.
The `update` method modifies the dictionary in-place and returns `None`, so the `or` operator is used to return the updated dictionary `z` instead.

In summary, `method_7` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using a lambda function.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary is preserved.
This method is efficient in terms of memory usage, but it may be less intuitive than other methods due to the use of a lambda function.
===== Advantages 1. **Efficiency:** This method is efficient in terms of memory usage.
The lambda function generates the output on the fly and does not store it in memory, which can be beneficial for large dictionaries.

2. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.

3. **Preservation of Original Dictionaries:** The `copy` method creates a new dictionary, which means the original dictionaries are not modified during the merge process.
This can be beneficial if you need to use the original dictionaries later in your code.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** This method uses a lambda function, which may be less intuitive for developers who are not familiar with these concepts.

2. **Single Use:** The lambda function is a single-use function.
This means that once the function has been used, it cannot be reused.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the copy method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary.
This is because each element in the dictionary needs to be copied to the new dictionary.
The update method also has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because each key-value pair in the second dictionary needs to be inserted into the first dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the merged dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
However, it's worth noting that the lambda function itself does not consume additional space as it generates the output on the fly.

    return {k: v for d in [x, y] for k, v in d.items()}
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_8` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns a new dictionary that is a combination of the two.

The function uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this.
A dictionary comprehension is a concise way to create dictionaries using a single line of code.
It follows the format `{key: value for (key, value) in iterable}`.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
{k: v for d in [x, y] for k, v in d.items()}
----

In this snippet, `[x, y]` is a list of the two input dictionaries.
The outer `for` loop iterates over this list, and for each dictionary `d`, the inner `for` loop iterates over the key-value pairs in `d`.
For each key-value pair, a new entry is added to the resulting dictionary.

In summary, `method_8` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using a dictionary comprehension.
It creates a new dictionary that includes all key-value pairs from both input dictionaries.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary is preserved.
This method is efficient in terms of memory usage and execution speed, but it may be less intuitive than other methods due to the use of a dictionary comprehension.
===== Advantages 1. **Efficiency:** This method is efficient in terms of memory usage and execution speed.
The dictionary comprehension generates the output on the fly and does not store it in memory, which can be beneficial for large dictionaries.

2. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.

3. **Simplicity:** Dictionary comprehensions are a concise way to create dictionaries, which can make your code shorter and easier to read.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** This method uses a dictionary comprehension, which may be less intuitive for developers who are not familiar with these concepts.
It might take some time to understand how it works, especially for beginners.

2. **Single Use:** The dictionary comprehension is a single-use expression.
This means that once the dictionary has been created, the comprehension cannot be reused.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the dictionary comprehension is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because the comprehension needs to iterate over each key-value pair in both dictionaries once.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because a new dictionary is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new dictionary is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
However, it's worth noting that the dictionary comprehension itself does not consume additional space as it generates the output on the fly.
==== Tests === Method 9:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_9(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """Update Method

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    x.update(y)
    return x
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_9` that merges two dictionaries.

It takes two dictionaries as arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns the updated dictionary `x`.

The function uses the `update` method of Python dictionaries to achieve this.
The `update` method takes another dictionary as an argument and adds its key-value pairs to the original dictionary.
If a key already exists in the original dictionary, its value is updated with the value from the second dictionary.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

[source,python]
----
x.update(y)
----

In this snippet, `x` is the original dictionary and `y` is the second dictionary.
The `update` method adds all key-value pairs from `y` to `x`.
If a key from `y` already exists in `x`, the value in `x` is replaced with the value from `y`.

The function then returns the updated dictionary `x`:

[source,python]
----
return x
----

In summary, `method_9` is a way to merge two dictionaries in Python using the `update` method.
It modifies the original dictionary `x` by adding all key-value pairs from the second dictionary `y`.
In case of duplicate keys, the value from `y` is preserved.
This method is straightforward and easy to understand, but it modifies the original dictionary, which might not be desirable in all cases.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses the built-in `update` method of Python dictionaries, which makes it accessible for developers of all experience levels.

2. **In-place Update:** The `update` method modifies the original dictionary in-place, which means no additional space is required to create a new dictionary.
This can be beneficial in terms of memory efficiency.

3. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This is useful when you want the second dictionary's values to take precedence over the first's in case of key collisions.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Modification of Original Dictionary:** The `update` method modifies the original dictionary.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve the original dictionary for later use in your code.

2. **Overwriting of Duplicate Keys:** In case of duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first.
This could be a disadvantage if you want to preserve all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.

3. **Return Type:** The `update` method returns `None`, so you need to return the updated dictionary separately.
This could be a disadvantage if you prefer methods that return the result directly.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the update method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because each key-value pair in the second dictionary needs to be inserted into the first dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it updates the first dictionary in-place and does not create any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
The update method modifies the original dictionary and does not require additional space proportional to the size of the input dictionaries.
==== Tests === Method 10:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_10(x: dict, y: dict) -> dict:
    """DefaultDict Method

    Args:
        x: dict
        y: dict

    Returns:
        dict
    """
    merged = defaultdict(list)
    for d in (x, y):
        for key, value in d.items():
            merged[key].append(value)
    return merged
----

==== Explanation The provided code is a Python function named `method_10` that merges two dictionaries.

It uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to handle the merging process.
A `defaultdict` is a dictionary subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values, in this case, a list.

The function starts by creating a `defaultdict` named `merged`:

[source,python]
----
merged = defaultdict(list)
----

In this line, `list` is the factory function for the `defaultdict`.
This means that if a key is not found in the dictionary, it will be added with the value returned by the factory function, which is an empty list in this case.

Next, the function iterates over the input dictionaries `x` and `y`:

[source,python]
----
for d in (x, y):
----

For each dictionary `d`, the function iterates over its key-value pairs:

[source,python]
----
for key, value in d.items():
----

For each key-value pair, the function appends the value to the list of values for the corresponding key in the `merged` dictionary:

[source,python]
----
merged[key].append(value)
----

This means that if a key is present in both input dictionaries, its corresponding value in the `merged` dictionary will be a list containing the values from both dictionaries.

Finally, the function returns the `merged` dictionary:

[source,python]
----
return merged
----

In summary, `method_10` is a Python function that merges two dictionaries into a `defaultdict` where each key maps to a list of values.
If a key is present in both input dictionaries, its corresponding value in the `merged` dictionary is a list containing the values from both dictionaries.
This method preserves all values and does not overwrite any of them, which might be desirable in certain use cases.
===== Advantages 1. **Preservation of All Values:** This method preserves all values from both dictionaries, even if the keys are the same.
This is because it uses a list to store the values for each key.
If a key is present in both dictionaries, its corresponding value in the merged dictionary will be a list containing the values from both dictionaries.
This can be beneficial if you want to keep all values for keys that appear in both dictionaries.

2. **Use of DefaultDict:** The `defaultdict` is a dictionary subclass that provides a default value for a nonexistent key, which simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
It automatically initializes the dictionary with a default value if a key has not been set, which is a list in this case.

3. **In-place Update:** The function updates the `defaultdict` in-place, which can be more memory efficient than methods that create and return a new dictionary.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Additional Complexity:** This method might be a bit more complex to understand for beginners or developers not familiar with `defaultdict` or the concept of factory functions.

2. **Output Format:** The output is a `defaultdict` where each key maps to a list of values.
This might not be the desired format in all cases, especially if you only want to keep the last value for keys that appear in both dictionaries.

3. **Performance:** If the dictionaries are large, this method might be less efficient than other methods that don't require iterating over the key-value pairs of the dictionaries.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of this function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because the function needs to iterate over each key-value pair in both dictionaries once.
====== Space The space complexity of the function is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the first dictionary and m is the number of elements in the second dictionary.
This is because a new defaultdict is created to store the merged result.
The space required for this new defaultdict is proportional to the total number of elements in the two input dictionaries.
However, it's worth noting that the defaultdict itself does not consume additional space as it generates the output on the fly.
