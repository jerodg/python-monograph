== Solution(s)

[.lead]
=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_00` that calculates the product sum of a nested array.
The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements multiplied by their respective depths.
If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated recursively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

The function `solution_00` takes two arguments: `arr` and `depth`. `arr` is a list that can contain integers or other nested lists. `depth` is an integer representing the current depth level.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_00(arr: list[int | list], depth: int) -> int:
----

The function first checks if the `depth` argument is an integer.
If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
if not isinstance(depth, int):
    raise TypeError('depth must be an integer')
----

The function then initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0. This variable will hold the final product sum.

[source,python,linenums]
----
total_sum = 0
----

Next, the function iterates over the elements in the `arr` list.
If an element is a list, the function recursively calculates its product sum and adds it to `total_sum`.
If the element is an integer, it simply adds it to `total_sum`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
for ele in arr:
    total_sum += solution_00(ele, depth + 1) if isinstance(ele, list) else ele
----

Finally, the function multiplies `total_sum` by the current `depth` and returns the result.
This is the final product sum of the array.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return total_sum * depth
----

In summary, the function `solution_00` uses recursion to calculate the product sum of a nested array, taking into account the depth of each element in the array.

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: Recursion provides a straightforward way to traverse nested data structures like the one in this problem.
The code is easier to understand and write because it follows the natural structure of the problem.

2. **Depth Handling**: The recursive approach inherently handles the depth of nested arrays.
Each recursive call increases the depth by one, which aligns with the requirement of the problem to multiply the sum of elements by their respective depths.

3. **Flexibility**: The function can handle arrays of arbitrary depth without any modifications.
This makes it flexible and applicable to a wide range of inputs.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Stack Overflow Risk**: Recursion relies on the call stack to keep track of recursive calls.
If the array is deeply nested, it could lead to a stack overflow error.

2. **Performance Overhead**: Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, which can lead to significant performance overhead for large inputs.
This overhead includes the time it takes to add and remove stack frames, as well as the memory used by the stack.

3. **Difficulty in Debugging**: Debugging recursive functions can be more challenging than iterative ones because of the additional complexity introduced by the call stack.
It can be hard to follow the flow of execution and understand the state of the program at each recursive call.

4. **No Tail Call Optimization**: Python does not support tail call optimization, a feature in some languages that optimizes recursive calls to avoid increasing the stack size.
This means that Python recursive functions can be less efficient and risk causing a stack overflow for large inputs.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the selected code is as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function `solution_00` is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the array, including the elements of the nested arrays.
This is because each element in the array (including nested arrays) is visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(d), where d is the maximum depth of the nested arrays.
This is because in the worst-case scenario, if the array is deeply nested, a recursive call will be made for each level of depth, and each call adds a new layer to the system call stack.
The maximum depth of the array determines the maximum size of the stack.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `solution_01` that calculates the product sum of a nested array using an iterative method with a stack.
The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements multiplied by their respective depths.
If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated iteratively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

The function `solution_01` takes one argument `arr`, which is a list that can contain integers or other nested lists.
The function returns an integer which is the product sum of the array.

The function starts by initializing a stack and pushing the input array and its depth (which is 1) into the stack.
This is done with the line `stack = [(arr, 1)]`.
It also initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0. This variable will hold the final product sum.

The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the stack is not empty.
In each iteration of the loop, it pops an element from the stack.
This element is a tuple containing an array and its depth, as shown in the line `current_arr, depth = stack.pop()`.

Next, the function iterates over the array.
For each element in the array, it checks if it is a list or an integer.
If the element is a list, it pushes it into the stack along with its depth (which is the current depth + 1).
This is done with the line `stack.append((ele, depth + 1))`.
If the element is an integer, it adds it to `total_sum` multiplied by the depth.

Finally, after all elements have been processed and the stack is empty, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the product sum of the array.

==== Advantages

1. **Iterative Approach**: The code uses an iterative approach with a stack to handle the nested lists.
This approach is generally more efficient in terms of memory usage compared to a recursive approach, as it avoids the overhead of function call stack frames.
2. **Generality**: The function can handle any level of nesting within the input list.
It does not have a fixed limit on the depth of the nested lists.
3. **Type Checking**: The function uses the `isinstance` function to check if an element is a list or an integer.
This ensures that the function can handle mixed lists that contain both integers and other lists.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Error Handling**: The function does not have any error handling for invalid inputs.
For example, if the input list contains elements that are neither integers nor lists, the function will raise an error.
2. **In-place Modification**: The function modifies the input list in-place by using it to initialize the stack.
This could lead to unexpected side effects if the caller does not expect the input list to be modified.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: The function is doing multiple things - iterating over the list, checking the type of each element, and calculating the product sum.
This could make the function harder to understand and maintain.
It might be better to split these responsibilities into separate functions.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code is as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the array (including elements within nested arrays).

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected Python code defines a function `solution_02` that calculates the product sum of a nested array using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements, where each element is multiplied by its depth.
If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated iteratively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

The function `solution_02` takes one argument `arr`, which is a list that can contain integers or other nested lists.
The function returns an integer which is the product sum of the array.

The function starts by initializing a queue and enqueuing the input array and its depth (which is 1) into the queue.
This is done with the line `queue = deque([(arr, 1)])`.
It also initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0. This variable will hold the final product sum.

The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty.
In each iteration of the loop, it dequeues an element from the queue.
This element is a tuple containing an array and its depth, as shown in the line `current_arr, depth = queue.popleft()`.

Next, the function iterates over the array.
For each element in the array, it checks if it is a list or an integer.
If the element is a list, it enqueues it into the queue along with its depth (which is the current depth + 1).
This is done with the line `queue.append((ele, depth + 1))`.
If the element is an integer, it adds it to `total_sum` multiplied by the depth.

Finally, after all elements have been processed and the queue is empty, the function returns `total_sum`, which is the product sum of the array.

==== Advantages

1. **Breadth-First Search**: The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to handle the nested lists.
This approach is efficient and can handle any level of nesting within the input list.
2. **Generality**: The function can handle any level of nesting within the input list.
It does not have a fixed limit on the depth of the nested lists.
3. **Type Checking**: The function uses the `isinstance` function to check if an element is a list or an integer.
This ensures that the function can handle mixed lists that contain both integers and other lists.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Error Handling**: The function does not have any error handling for invalid inputs.
For example, if the input list contains elements that are neither integers nor lists, the function will raise an error.
2. **In-place Modification**: The function modifies the input list in-place by using it to initialize the queue.
This could lead to unexpected side effects if the caller does not expect the input list to be modified.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: The function is doing multiple things - iterating over the list, checking the type of each element, and calculating the product sum.
This could make the function harder to understand and maintain.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(d), where d is the maximum depth of the nested arrays.
This is because in the worst-case scenario, if the array is deeply nested, the function will enqueue each level of depth into the queue.
The maximum depth of the array determines the maximum size of the queue.

=== Solution 03

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_03.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected Python code consists of two functions, `iterate` and `solution_03`, which work together to calculate the product sum of a nested array.
The product sum of an array is the sum of its elements, where each element is multiplied by its depth.
If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated iteratively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

The `iterate` function is a generator function that performs a depth-first traversal of the array and its nested arrays.
It takes two arguments, `arr` and `depth`. `arr` is a list that can contain integers or other nested lists, and `depth` is an integer representing the current depth level.
The function yields each integer in the array along with its depth.
It does this by iterating over the array and checking if each element is a list or an integer.
If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself with the list and an increased depth.
If the element is an integer, it yields the integer along with its depth.
This is shown in the following code snippet:

[source,python,linenums]
----
for ele in arr:
    if isinstance(ele, list):
        yield from iterate(ele, depth + 1)
    else:
        yield ele, depth
----

The `solution_03` function calculates the product sum of a nested array using the `iterate` function.
It takes one argument `arr`, which is a list that can contain integers or other nested lists.
The function initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0. This variable will hold the final product sum.
It then uses the `iterate` function to iterate over the array and its nested arrays.
For each integer and its depth yielded by the `iterate` function, it adds the integer multiplied by the depth to `total_sum`.
Finally, it returns `total_sum`, which is the product sum of the array.
This is shown in the following code snippet:

[source,python,linenums]
----
total_sum = 0
for value, depth in iterate(arr):
    total_sum += value * depth
return total_sum
----

In summary, the code uses a depth-first traversal to iterate over a nested array and calculate the product sum of its elements, taking into account their depth in the array.

==== Advantages

1. **Depth-First Search**: The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with recursion to handle the nested lists.
This approach is efficient and can handle any level of nesting within the input list.
2. **Generality**: The function can handle any level of nesting within the input list.
It does not have a fixed limit on the depth of the nested lists.
3. **Type Checking**: The function uses the `isinstance` function to check if an element is a list or an integer.
This ensures that the function can handle mixed lists that contain both integers and other lists.
4. **Generator Function**: The use of a generator function (`iterate`) allows the function to handle large inputs without consuming a lot of memory, as it yields one result at a time.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Error Handling**: The function does not have any error handling for invalid inputs.
For example, if the input list contains elements that are neither integers nor lists, the function will raise an error.
2. **Recursion**: The use of recursion in the `iterate` function could lead to a stack overflow error if the depth of the nested lists is too large.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: The function is doing multiple things - iterating over the list, checking the type of each element, and calculating the product sum.
This could make the function harder to understand and maintain.
It might be better to split these responsibilities into separate functions.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code is as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the array (including elements within nested arrays).
This is because each element in the array (including nested arrays) is visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(d), where d is the maximum depth of the nested arrays.
This is because in the worst-case scenario, if the array is deeply nested, the function will enqueue each level of depth into the queue.
The maximum depth of the array determines the maximum size of the queue.
