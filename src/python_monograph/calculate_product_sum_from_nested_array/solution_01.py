def solution_01(arr: list[int | list]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the product sum of a nested array using an iterative method with a stack.

    The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements multiplied by
    their respective depths.  If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated
    iteratively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

    Args:
        arr (list[int | list]): The array of integers and nested lists.

    Returns:
        int: The product sum of the array.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_01([1, 2, 3])
        6
        >>> solution_01([-1, 2, [-3, 4]])
        8
        >>> solution_01([1, 2, 3, [4, 5]])
        23
        >>> solution_01([1, -1])
        0
        >>> solution_01([1, -2])
        -1
        >>> solution_01([-3.5, [1, [0.5]]])
        1.5
