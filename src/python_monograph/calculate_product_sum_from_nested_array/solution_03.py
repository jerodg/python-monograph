    Generator function that iterates over the array and its nested arrays in a depth-first manner.

    This function yields each integer in the array along with its depth.

    Args:
        arr (list[int | list]): The array of integers and nested lists.
        depth (int): The current depth level.

    Yields:
        tuple: A tuple containing an integer from the array and its depth.

    Examples:
        >>> list(iterate([1, 2, 3]))
        [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]

    Calculates the product sum of a nested array using a generator function.

    The product sum of an array is defined as the sum of its elements multiplied by
    their respective depths.  If an element is a list, its product sum is calculated
    iteratively by multiplying the sum of its elements with its depth plus one.

    Args:
        arr (list[int | list]): The array of integers and nested lists.

    Returns:
        int: The product sum of the array.

    Examples:
