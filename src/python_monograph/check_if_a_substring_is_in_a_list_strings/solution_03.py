def solution_03(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
    """This function checks if a given substring is found in a joined string of a list using the join() method.

    The join() method concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string with a specified delimiter.
    In this case, the delimiter is a tab character ("\t").

    After joining the strings, the function checks if the substring is found in the resulting string.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings to be joined and where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the joined string.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in the joined string, False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> solution_03(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'app')
        True
    >>> solution_03(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'z')
        False
