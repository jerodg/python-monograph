=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_00` that checks if a given substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two parameters: `data`, which is a list of strings, and `substr`, which is the substring to be searched for.

The function begins with a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, parameters, return value, and usage.
It also includes a note that the function does not provide the location of the substring in the string, and references to the Python documentation for the `any()` function.

The function's logic starts with two error checking conditions.
The first condition checks if the `substr` parameter is `None`.
If it is, a `TypeError` is raised with the message "NoneType found in substr".
This is to ensure that the function does not attempt to search for a `None` value, which would not make sense in this context.

[source,python]
----
if substr is None:
    raise TypeError("NoneType found in substr")
----

The second condition checks if any element in the `data` list is `None`.
If it is, a `TypeError` is raised with the message "NoneType found in list".
This is to ensure that the function does not attempt to search within a `None` value, which would result in an error.

[source,python]
----
if None in data:
    raise TypeError("NoneType found in list")
----

After these error checks, the function uses the `any()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if the substring is in any string in the list.
The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one element is `True`, and the 'in' operator checks if the substring is a part of each string.
The 'for' loop iterates over each string in the list.
If the substring is found in any string, the function returns `True`.
Otherwise, it returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
return any(substr in x for x in data)
----

This function is a concise and efficient way to check if a substring is present in any string in a list, and it includes robust error checking to handle potential issues with the input data.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The `any()` function is a built-in Python function, which is highly optimized and efficient.
It stops and returns `True` as soon as it finds a `True` element, making it a quick way to check for the presence of a substring.
2. **Simplicity**: The use of a generator expression simplifies the code by combining the iteration over the list and the search for the substring into a single line.
This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
3. **Error Handling**: The function includes error checking to handle potential issues with the input data.
It checks if the substring or any element in the list is `None` and raises a `TypeError` if it is.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Limited Information**: The function only returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring was found in the list.
It does not provide any information about where the substring was found.
If this information is needed, the function would need to be modified or a different approach would need to be used.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: The `in` operator is case sensitive, so the function will not find a match if the case of the substring does not match the case of the strings in the list.
If case-insensitive matching is required, the function would need to be modified.
3. **Error Handling**: While the function does handle `None` values in the input, it might not be the most appropriate way to handle this situation.
It might be better to simply ignore `None` values or to return a specific value indicating that the list or the substring contained invalid data.

==== Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The function uses the `any()` function in combination with a generator expression to iterate over each string in the `data` list.
For each string, it checks if the substring is found in the string using the `in` operator.
Both the `any()` function and the `in` operator have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Therefore, the total time complexity of the function is O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input.
The function only uses a few variables to store the input parameters and the result, so the space complexity is constant.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `method_01` that checks if a given substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two parameters: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings where the substring will be searched, and `substr` is the substring to search in the list of strings.

The function signature is as follows:

[source,python]
----
def method_01(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
----

This indicates that the function `method_01` takes in two arguments, `data` which is a list of strings, and `substr` which is a string.
The function returns a boolean value.

The function uses the `find()` method of Python strings.
The `find()` method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found.
If the substring is not found, the `find()` method returns -1. In this case, the function iterates over each string `row` in the list `data`, and checks if the substring `substr` is found in `row`.

The relevant lines of code are:

[source,python]
----
for row in data:
    if row.find(substr) != -1:  # Returns -1 if not found
        return True
----

These lines of code will return `True` if the substring `substr` is found in any string in the list `data`, and `False` otherwise.

It's important to note that this function does not provide the location of the substring in the string.
It only checks for the existence of the substring in the list of strings.

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions and language features, making it accessible to developers familiar with Python.

2. **Efficiency**: The `find()` method stops iterating as soon as it finds an element in the iterable that satisfies the condition.
This means that in the best-case scenario (the substring is found in the first string), the function has a time complexity of O(1).
In the worst-case scenario (the substring is not found or is in the last string), the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all strings in the list.

3. **Versatility**: This method can handle any list of strings and any substring, including empty strings and lists.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Lack of Detailed Information**: The method only checks for the existence of the substring in the list of strings.
It does not provide the location of the substring in the string or in which string(s) the substring was found.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: Python's `find()` method is case-sensitive, which means that the method might not work as expected if the case of the substring and the strings in the list do not match.
If case-insensitive matching is required, additional steps would need to be taken (such as converting all strings to lower or upper case before the check).

3. **No Pattern Matching**: The method checks for exact matches of the substring in the strings in the list.
It does not support pattern matching or regular expressions.
If more complex searches are required, a different method might be more suitable.

==== Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings.
This is because for each string in the list, the function checks if the substring exists within it.
The 'find()' method, used to check if the substring exists in a string, has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the string.
Therefore, if there are n strings in the list, the total time complexity becomes O(n*m).

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(1), which means it uses constant space.
This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and variables, and does not use any additional data structures whose size depends on the input.

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_02` that checks if a given substring is found in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two parameters: `data`, which is a list of strings, and `substr`, which is the substring to be searched for.

The function begins by checking if `None` is present in the `data` list.
If `None` is found, it raises an `AttributeError`.
This is done to ensure that the list does not contain any `None` values, which could cause issues when the `find()` method is called on them.

[source,python]
----
if None in data:
    raise AttributeError('NoneType found in list')
----

The main logic of the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the `data` list and apply the `find()` method.
The `find()` method is a built-in Python method that returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found.
If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1.

[source,python]
----
[x for x in data if x.find(substr) != -1]
----

The list comprehension will return a list with at least one element if the substring is found in any string (i.e., if `find()` does not return -1).
If the substring is not found in any string, the list comprehension will return an empty list.

Finally, the function returns `True` if the list comprehension returns a non-empty list (i.e., the substring was found in at least one string in the list), and `False` otherwise.

[source,python]
----
return True if [x for x in data if x.find(substr) != -1] else False
----

In summary, `solution_02` is a Python function that checks if a given substring is present in any string within a provided list.
It uses the `find()` method and a list comprehension to achieve this.

NOTE: This method will fail if the list contains `None` values.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The `find()` method is a built-in Python method, which is highly optimized and efficient.
It returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found, or -1 if the substring is not found.
This makes it a quick and efficient way to check for the presence of a substring.
2. **Simplicity**: The use of a list comprehension simplifies the code by combining the iteration over the list and the application of the `find()` method into a single line.
This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
3. **Flexibility**: The function can handle any list of strings and any substring, making it a flexible solution for checking the presence of a substring in a list of strings.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Error Handling**: The function raises an `AttributeError` if `None` is found in the list.
While this prevents the function from failing when it encounters a `None` value, it may not be the most appropriate way to handle this situation.
It might be better to simply ignore `None` values or to return a specific value indicating that the list contained invalid data.
2. **Limited Information**: The function only returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring was found in any string in the list.
It does not provide any information about where the substring was found, or in which strings.
If this information is needed, the function would need to be modified or a different approach would need to be used.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The `find()` method is case sensitive, so the function will not find a match if the case of the substring does not match the case of the strings in the list.
If case-insensitive matching is required, the function would need to be modified.

==== Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The `find()` method, used to check if the substring exists in a string, has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the string.
Therefore, if there are n strings in the list, the total time complexity becomes O(n*m).

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(1), which means it uses constant space.
This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and variables, and does not use any additional data structures whose size depends on the input.

=== Solution 03

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_03.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_03` that checks if a given substring is found in a joined string of a list.
The function takes two parameters: `data`, which is a list of strings, and `substr`, which is the substring to be searched for.

The function begins by checking if `substr` or any element in `data` is `None`.
If `None` is found, it raises a `TypeError`.
This is done to ensure that the substring and the list do not contain any `None` values, which could cause issues when the `join()` method is called on them.

[source,python]
----
if substr is None:
    raise TypeError('NoneType found in substr')

if None in data:
    raise TypeError('NoneType found in list')
----

The main logic of the function uses the `join()` method to concatenate all the strings in the `data` list into a single string with a specified delimiter.
In this case, the delimiter is a tab character ("\t").

[source,python]
----
"\t".join(data)
----

After joining the strings, the function checks if the substring is found in the resulting string using the `in` keyword.
The `in` keyword in Python is used to check if a value exists in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string etc.).

[source,python]
----
return substr in "\t".join(data)
----

In summary, `solution_03` is a Python function that checks if a given substring is present in a joined string of a provided list.
It uses the `join()` method and the `in` keyword to achieve this.

NOTE: This method will fail if the list or the substring contains `None` values.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The `join()` method is a built-in Python method, which is highly optimized and efficient.
It concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, which can then be searched for the substring.
This makes it a quick and efficient way to check for the presence of a substring.
2. **Simplicity**: The use of the `join()` method and the `in` keyword simplifies the code by combining the joining of the strings and the search for the substring into a single line.
This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
3. **Flexibility**: The function can handle any list of strings and any substring, making it a flexible solution for checking the presence of a substring in a list of strings.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Error Handling**: The function raises a `TypeError` if `None` is found in the list or in the substring.
While this prevents the function from failing when it encounters a `None` value, it may not be the most appropriate way to handle this situation.
It might be better to simply ignore `None` values or to return a specific value indicating that the list or the substring contained invalid data.
2. **Limited Information**: The function only returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring was found in the joined string.
It does not provide any information about where the substring was found.
If this information is needed, the function would need to be modified or a different approach would need to be used.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The `in` keyword is case sensitive, so the function will not find a match if the case of the substring does not match the case of the strings in the list.
If case-insensitive matching is required, the function would need to be modified.
4. **Delimiter**: The function uses a tab character as a delimiter when joining the strings.
This could potentially cause issues if the strings in the list or the substring contain tab characters.

==== Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The `join()` method, used to concatenate all the strings in the list into a single string, has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total length of all the strings in the list.
The `in` keyword, used to check if the substring exists in the joined string, also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the joined string.
Therefore, the total time complexity of the function is O(n + n) = O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total length of all the strings in the list.
This is because the `join()` method creates a new string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
The size of this new string depends on the total length of all the strings in the list, so the space complexity is O(n).

[source,python]
----
for row in data:
    if substr in row:
        return True
----

If the substring is found in any string, the function immediately returns `True`.
If the substring is not found in any string after iterating over the entire list, the function returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
return False
----

In summary, `solution_04` is a Python function that checks if a given substring is present in any string of a provided list.
It uses a for-loop and the `in` keyword to achieve this.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The `in` keyword is a built-in Python operator, which is highly optimized and efficient.
It checks for the presence of a substring in a string, making it a quick and efficient way to check for the presence of a substring.
2. **Simplicity**: The use of a for-loop and the `in` keyword simplifies the code by combining the iteration over the list and the search for the substring into a few lines.
This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
3. **Flexibility**: The function can handle any list of strings and any substring, making it a flexible solution for checking the presence of a substring in a list of strings.
