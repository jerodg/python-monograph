    """This function checks if a given substring is present in any of the strings in a list using the any() function.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in any string in the list, False otherwise.

    Note:
        This function does not provide the location of the substring in the string.

    Example:
    >>> solution_00(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'app')
        True
    >>> solution_00(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'z')
        False
