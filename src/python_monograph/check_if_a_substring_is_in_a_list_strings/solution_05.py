def solution_05(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
    """This function checks if a given substring is found in any of the strings in a list using a list comprehension.

    The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the list.
    For each string, it checks if the substring is found in the string using the 'in' operator.
    If the substring is found in any string (the list comprehension returns a list with at least one element), the function
    returns True.
    If the substring is not found in any string (the list comprehension returns an empty list), the function returns False.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in any string in the list, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the substring or any element in the list is None.

    Example:
    >>> solution_05(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'app')
        True
    >>> solution_05(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'z')
        False
