def solution_02(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
    """This function checks if a given substring is found in any of the strings in a list using the find() method and a list
    comprehension.

    The find() method returns the lowest (first) index in the string where the substring is found within the slice.
    If the substring is not found, the find() method returns -1.

    A list comprehension is used to iterate over the list of strings and apply the find() method to each string.
    If the substring is found in any string (find() method does not return -1), the list comprehension will return a list with at
    least one element, and the function will return True.
    If the substring is not found in any string, the list comprehension will return an empty list, and the function will return
    False.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in any string in the list, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        AttributeError: If any element in the list is None.

    Example:
    >>> solution_02(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'app')
        True
    >>> solution_02(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], 'z')
        False
