== Solution(s)

[.lead]
=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_00` that merges two sorted integer arrays into one sorted array.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.
Here, `nums1` is the first sorted integer array with a size of `m+n`, where the first `m` elements are the elements to consider for merging, and the rest are zeros. `nums2` is the second sorted integer array, and `n` is the number of elements in `nums2` to consider for merging.

The function begins by creating a copy of the first `m` elements of `nums1` and then clears `nums1`.
This is done using the following lines of code:

[source,python]
----
nums1_copy = nums1[:m]
nums1 = []
----

Next, the function initializes two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, each pointing to the start of `nums1_copy` and `nums2` respectively.
This is achieved with:

[source,python]
----
p1 = 0
p2 = 0
----

The function then enters a while loop, which continues as long as both pointers are within the range of their respective arrays.
Inside the loop, the function compares the elements pointed by the pointers and appends the smaller one into `nums1`.
The corresponding pointer is then incremented.
This is done using the following code:

[source,python]
----
if nums1_copy[p1] <= nums2[p2]:
    nums1.append(nums1_copy[p1])
    p1 += 1
else:
    nums1.append(nums2[p2])
    p2 += 1
----

After the loop, if there are remaining elements in `nums1_copy` or `nums2`, they are appended into `nums1`.
This is done using the following code:

[source,python]
----
if p1 < m:
    nums1[p1 + p2 :] = nums1_copy[p1:]
if p2 < n:
    nums1[p1 + p2 :] = nums2[p2:]
----

Finally, the function returns the merged sorted array `nums1`.
The function uses a two-pointer technique, where each pointer points to the start of each array and moves forward as we process each element.
This technique allows the function to merge the two arrays in a time-efficient manner.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The two-pointer technique is a time-efficient way to merge two sorted arrays.
It processes each element only once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(m+n), where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays.
This is significantly faster than other methods that might have a time complexity of O((m+n) log(m+n)), such as combining the two arrays and then sorting the result.

2. **In-place**: The method modifies one of the input arrays (`nums1`) to store the result, which saves auxiliary space.
This is beneficial when dealing with large arrays where extra space could be a concern.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Destructive**: This method modifies the input array `nums1`, which might not be desirable in all cases.
If the original arrays are needed later in the code, this method would not be suitable.

2. **Limited applicability**: This method specifically handles the case where `nums1` has enough space at the end to accommodate `nums2`.
If this is not the case, the method would need to be adjusted.

3. **Zero placeholders**: The method assumes that the extra space in `nums1` is filled with zeros.
If the array contains meaningful zeros, this method might produce incorrect results.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the function is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input arrays.
This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function will need to iterate through all elements of both arrays once.
The while loop runs until we have processed all elements in both arrays, which gives us a linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(m), where m is the length of the first input array.
This is because we are creating a copy of the first m elements of `nums1`.
The rest of the variables used in the function (`nums1`, `p1`, `p2`) take constant space.
Therefore, the space complexity is linear in the size of the first input array.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `solution_01` that merges two sorted integer arrays into one sorted array.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.
Here, `nums1` is the first sorted integer array with a size of `m+n`, where the first `m` elements are the elements to consider for merging, and the rest are zeros. `nums2` is the second sorted integer array, and `n` is the number of elements in `nums2` to consider for merging.

The function begins by initializing two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, each pointing to the end of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
This is achieved with:

```python
p1 = m - 1
p2 = n - 1
```

Next, the function initializes a third pointer `p` for the last unprocessed position in `nums1`:

[source,python]
----
p = m + n - 1
----

The function then enters a while loop, which continues as long as both pointers `p1` and `p2` are within the range of their respective arrays.
Inside the loop, the function compares the elements pointed by the pointers and puts the larger one into the last unprocessed position in `nums1`.
The corresponding pointer is then decremented.
This is done using the following code:

[source,python]
----
if nums1[p1] <= nums2[p2]:
    nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
    p2 -= 1
else:
    nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
    p1 -= 1
p -= 1
----

After the loop, if there are remaining elements in `nums2`, they are appended into the unprocessed positions in `nums1`.
This is done using the following code:

[source,python]
----
if p2 >= 0:
    nums1[: p2 + 1] = nums2[: p2 + 1]
----

Finally, the function returns the merged sorted array `nums1`.
The function uses a two-pointer technique, where each pointer points to the end of each array and moves backward as we process each element.
This technique allows the function to merge the two arrays in a time-efficient manner.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The two-pointer technique is a time-efficient way to merge two sorted arrays.
It processes each element only once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(m+n), where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays.
This is significantly faster than other methods that might have a time complexity of O((m+n) log(m+n)), such as combining the two arrays and then sorting the result.

2. **In-place**: The method modifies one of the input arrays (`nums1`) to store the result, which saves auxiliary space.
This is beneficial when dealing with large arrays where extra space could be a concern.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Destructive**: This method modifies the input array `nums1`, which might not be desirable in all cases.
If the original arrays are needed later in the code, this method would not be suitable.

2. **Limited applicability**: This method specifically handles the case where `nums1` has enough space at the end to accommodate `nums2`.
If this is not the case, the method would need to be adjusted.

3. **Zero placeholders**: The method assumes that the extra space in `nums1` is filled with zeros.
If the array contains meaningful zeros, this method might produce incorrect results.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the function is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input arrays.
This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function will need to iterate through all elements of both arrays once.
The while loop runs until we have processed all elements in both arrays, which gives us a linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the function is O(1).
This is because the function modifies the input array `nums1` in-place and does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input.
All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p`) used in the function take constant space.
Therefore, the space complexity is constant.

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_02` that merges two sorted integer arrays into one sorted array.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.

`nums1` is the first sorted array, which has enough space to hold the additional elements from `nums2`. `m` is the number of initialized elements in `nums1`. `nums2` is the second sorted array, and `n` is the number of initialized elements in `nums2`.

The function begins by appending the second array to the first one.
This is done using the `+` operator, which concatenates the two lists.
The slice `nums1[:m]` is used to get the first `m` elements of `nums1`, and `nums2` is appended to this slice.
The result is a new list that contains the initialized elements of `nums1` followed by all elements of `nums2`.

[source,python]
----
nums1[:] = sorted(nums1[:m] + nums2)
----

The `sorted` function is then used to sort this combined list.
The sorted list is assigned back to `nums1` using slice assignment (`nums1[:] = ...`), which modifies the original list in-place.
This is important because the function is expected to store the result in `nums1` and does not return anything.

The function ends with a `return` statement, which returns the sorted list.
This is not necessary because the function is supposed to modify `nums1` in-place and does not need to return anything.
However, it does not harm and can be useful for testing or debugging purposes.

[source,python]
----
return nums1
----

The function is accompanied by a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, and return value.
It also includes a doctest, which is a simple way to test the function.
The doctest shows an example of how to call the function and what result to expect.

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions, which makes it more readable and maintainable.
2. **In-place operation**: The function modifies the first array in-place, which means it does not require additional space that scales with the size of the input.
This can be beneficial in terms of memory efficiency.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Limited applicability**: This method specifically handles the case where `nums1` has enough space at the end to accommodate `nums2`.
If this is not the case, the method would need to be adjusted.
2. **Zero placeholders**: The method assumes that the extra space in `nums1` is filled with zeros.
If the array contains meaningful zeros, this method might produce incorrect results.
3. **Built-in sort function**: The use of the built-in sort function may not be the most efficient way to merge two sorted arrays.
A more efficient approach would be to merge the arrays in a single pass, which can be done in linear time.
The built-in sort function has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is less efficient for large inputs.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this function is dominated by the sorting operation.
In Python, the built-in `sorted` function uses a sorting algorithm called Timsort, which has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the total number of elements in the combined list (`nums1` and `nums2`).
Therefore, the time complexity of this function is O((m+n) log (m+n)), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this function is O(m+n).
This is because the function creates a new list that contains all elements of `nums1` and `nums2` when it performs the operation `nums1[:m] + nums2`.
This new list requires O(m+n) space.
After the sorting operation, this temporary list is not needed anymore, and the space it occupied is released.
Therefore, the space complexity is not constant, but O(m+n).

=== Solution 03

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_03.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_03` that merges two sorted integer arrays into one sorted array.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.

`nums1` is the first sorted array, which has enough space to hold the additional elements from `nums2`. `m` is the number of initialized elements in `nums1`. `nums2` is the second sorted array, and `n` is the number of initialized elements in `nums2`.

The function starts by creating a new list, `nums3`.
It then appends the first `m` elements from `nums1` and the first `n` elements from `nums2` to `nums3`.

[source,python]
----
nums3 = []
for i in range(m):
    nums3.append(nums1[i])
for i in range(n):
    nums3.append(nums2[i])
----

Afterwards, it sorts `nums3` and replaces the first `m+n` elements in `nums1` with the sorted elements from `nums3`.

[source,python]
----
for i, num in enumerate(sorted(nums3)):
    nums1[i] = num
----

If `nums2` is empty (i.e., `n` equals 0), the function removes trailing zeros from `nums1`.

[source,python]
----
if n == 0:
    nums1 = nums1[:m]
----

Finally, the function returns `nums1`, which now contains the merged and sorted elements from the original `nums1` and `nums2`.

The function is accompanied by a docstring that provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, arguments, and return value.
It also includes a doctest, which is a simple way to test the function.
The doctest shows an example of how to call the function and what result to expect.

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions like `append` and `sorted`, which makes the code clean and readable.
2. **In-place operation**: The method modifies the first input array `nums1` in-place, which means it does not require additional space proportional to the input size, except for the temporary list `nums3`.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency**: The method is not the most efficient way to merge two sorted arrays.
It uses the built-in `sorted` function, which has a time complexity of O((m+n) log (m+n)), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
A more efficient approach would be to merge the arrays in a single pass, which can be done in linear time.
2. **Extra Space**: The method creates a new list `nums3` to hold elements from both `nums1` and `nums2`, which requires extra space.
Although this space is released after the sorting operation, it still increases the space complexity to O(m+n).
3. **Zero placeholders**: The method assumes that the extra space in `nums1` is filled with zeros.
If the array contains meaningful zeros, this method might produce incorrect results.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this function is O((m+n) log (m+n)).
This is because the function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements to be sorted.
In this case, the function is sorting a list that contains m+n elements, hence the time complexity is O((m+n) log (m+n)).

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this function is O(m+n).
This is because the function creates a new list that contains all elements of `nums1` and `nums2` when it performs the operation `nums1[:m] + nums2`.
This new list requires O(m+n) space.
After the sorting operation, this temporary list is not needed anymore, and the space it occupied is released.
Therefore, the space complexity is not constant, but O(m+n).

=== Solution 04

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_04.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_04` that merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array in-place.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.
Here, `nums1` is the first sorted integer array with a size of `m+n`, where the first `m` elements are the elements to consider for merging, and the rest are zeros. `nums2` is the second sorted integer array, and `n` is the number of elements in `nums2` to consider for merging.

[source,python]
----
def solution_04(nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> list[int]:
----

The function uses a two-pointer technique to merge the arrays.
Two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, are initialized to point to the end of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

[source,python]
----
p1, p2 = m - 1, n - 1
----

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each element in both arrays, starting from the end and moving towards the beginning.
The loop index `i` ranges from `m + n - 1` to `0`.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(m + n - 1, -1, -1):
----

Inside the loop, the function checks if the pointer `p1` is still within the range and if the current element in `nums1` is greater or equal to the current element in `nums2`.
If this condition is met, the current element in `nums1` is placed into the current position, and the pointer `p1` is moved backward.

[source,python]
----
if p1 >= 0 and (p2 < 0 or nums1[p1] >= nums2[p2]):
    nums1[i] = nums1[p1]
    p1 -= 1
----

Otherwise, if the pointer `p2` is still within the range, the current element in `nums2` is placed into the current position, and the pointer `p2` is moved backward.

[source,python]
----
else:
    if p2 >= 0:
        nums1[i] = nums2[p2]
        p2 -= 1
----

Finally, the function returns the first `m + n` elements of `nums1`, which now contains the merged sorted array.

[source,python]
----
return nums1[: m + n]
----

This function is efficient as it merges the arrays in a single pass, and it does not require additional space proportional to the input size, making it beneficial in terms of space complexity.
However, it overwrites the original data in `nums1` during the merging process, which might not be suitable if the original data in `nums1` is needed later.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The method is efficient as it merges the arrays in a single pass, which can be done in linear time.
This is achieved by using a two-pointer technique, where each pointer points to the end of each array and moves backward as we process each element.
2. **In-place operation**: The method modifies the first input array `nums1` in-place, which means it does not require additional space proportional to the input size.
This is beneficial in terms of space complexity.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Overwriting data**: The method overwrites the original data in `nums1` during the merging process.
If the original data in `nums1` is needed later, this method might not be suitable.
2. **Zero placeholders**: Similar to the previous method, this method assumes that the extra space in `nums1` is filled with zeros.
If the array contains meaningful zeros, this method might produce incorrect results.
3. **Dependent on sorted input**: This method assumes that the input arrays are sorted.
If the input arrays are not sorted, this method will not produce a correct result.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this function is O(m + n).
This is because the function uses a two-pointer technique, where each pointer points to the end of each array and moves backward as we process each element.
The function iterates over each element in both arrays once, hence the time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this function is O(1).
This is because the function merges the arrays in-place, meaning it does not use any additional space that scales with the input size.
The space used by the function is constant, regardless of the size of the input arrays.

=== Solution 05

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_05.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `solution_05` that merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted array.
The function takes four arguments: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`.
Here, `nums1` is the first sorted integer array with a size of `m+n`, where the first `m` elements are the elements to consider for merging, and the rest are zeros. `nums2` is the second sorted integer array, and `n` is the number of elements in `nums2` to consider for merging.

[source,python]
----
def solution_05(nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> list[int]:
----

The function first slices `nums1` up to the `m`th index. This operation removes any placeholder zeros at the end of `nums1`.

[source,python]
----
nums1[:] = nums1[:m]
----

Next, the function extends `nums1` with the elements of `nums2`.
This operation appends all elements from `nums2` to the end of `nums1`.

[source,python]
----
nums1.extend(nums2)
----

After merging the arrays, the function sorts the combined array in-place.
This operation rearranges the elements of `nums1` such that they are in ascending order.

[source,python]
----
nums1.sort()
----

Finally, the function returns `nums1`, which now contains the merged and sorted array.

[source,python]
----
return nums1
----

This function is simple and straightforward, as it directly uses built-in Python functions to merge and sort the arrays.
However, it may not be the most efficient solution for large arrays, as the sorting operation has a time complexity of O((m+n) log (m+n)).

==== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The method is simple and straightforward, as it directly uses built-in Python functions to merge and sort the arrays.
This makes the code easy to understand and maintain.
2. **In-place operation**: The method modifies the first input array `nums1` in-place, which means it does not require additional space proportional to the input size.
This is beneficial in terms of space complexity.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency**: The method may not be the most efficient solution for large arrays, as the sorting operation has a time complexity of O((m+n) log (m+n)).
This is higher than the time complexity of the two-pointer technique used in `solution_04`, which is O(m + n).
2. **Overwriting data**: Similar to `solution_04`, this method overwrites the original data in `nums1` during the merging process.
If the original data in `nums1` is needed later, this method might not be suitable.
3. **Dependent on sorted input**: This method assumes that the input arrays are sorted.
If the input arrays are not sorted, this method will not produce a correct result.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code, `solution_05`, are as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this function is O((m+n) log (m+n)).
This is because the function uses Python's built-in `sort` function to sort the combined array.
The `sort` function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
In this case, the combined array has m + n elements, hence the time complexity is O((m+n) log (m+n)).

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this function is O(1).
This is because the function merges the arrays in-place, meaning it does not use any additional space that scales with the input size.
The space used by the function is constant, regardless of the size of the input arrays.
