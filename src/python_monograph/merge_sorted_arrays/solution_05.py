    Merges two sorted integer arrays into one sorted array.

    This function takes two sorted integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, and merges them into a single sorted array.
    The function modifies nums1 in-place to include the elements of nums2 and then sorts the combined array.

    Args:
        nums1 (list[int]): The first sorted integer array. It has a size of m+n, where m is the number of initialized elements.
        m (int): The number of initialized elements in nums1.
        nums2 (list[int]): The second sorted integer array.
        n (int): The number of elements in nums2.

    Returns:
        list[int]: The merged and sorted array.

    Doctest:
        >>> solution_05([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 5, 6], 3)
        [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
