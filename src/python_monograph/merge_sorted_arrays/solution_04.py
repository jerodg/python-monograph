def solution_04(nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array in-place.

    This function takes two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, and merges them into a single sorted array in-place.
    The first m elements of nums1 and the first n elements of nums2 are considered for merging.
    The function uses a two-pointer technique, where each pointer points to the end of each array and moves backward as we
    process each element.

    Args:
        nums1 (list[int]): The first sorted integer array. It has a size of m+n, where the first m elements are the elements to
        consider for merging, and the rest are zeros.
        m (int): The number of elements in nums1 to consider for merging.
        nums2 (list[int]): The second sorted integer array.
        n (int): The number of elements in nums2 to consider for merging.

    Returns:
        list[int]: The merged sorted array.
