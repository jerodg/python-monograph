    """
    Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

    This function uses the built-in sort function in Python. It involves appending the second array to the first one
    and then using the built-in sort function in Python to sort the combined array.

    Args:
        nums1 (list[int]): The first sorted array, which has enough space to hold the additional elements from nums2.
        m (int): The number of initialized elements in nums1.
        nums2 (list[int]): The second sorted array.
        n (int): The number of initialized elements in nums2.

    Returns:
        None. The result is stored in nums1.

    Doctest:
        >>> nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
        >>> m = 3
        >>> nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
        >>> n = 3
        >>> solution_02(nums1, m, nums2, n)
        >>> print(nums1)
        [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
