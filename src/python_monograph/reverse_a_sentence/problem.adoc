== Problem

[.lead]
You need to reverse a sentence.

=== Use-Cases

Reversing a sentence is a common operation in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: In NLP, reversing a sentence can be used in certain language models or algorithms.
For example, in sequence-to-sequence models used for tasks like machine translation, the input sentence is often reversed to help the model learn better.

2. **Data Encryption**: In data encryption, reversing a sentence can be a simple method to obfuscate data.
It's not a strong method on its own, but it can be a part of more complex encryption algorithms.

3. **Palindrome Checking**: In algorithms that check for palindromes (words or sentences that read the same backward as forward), reversing a sentence is a fundamental operation.

4. **Text Animation**: In graphical user interfaces or text animation, reversing a sentence can be used to create certain visual effects.

5. **Data Structures Learning**: In computer science education, reversing a sentence is a common exercise for learning about data structures like stacks.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of reversing a sentence can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
