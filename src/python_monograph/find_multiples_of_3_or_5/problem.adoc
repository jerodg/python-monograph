== Problem

[.lead]
If we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5` , we get `3, 5, 6, 9`.
The sum of those multiples is `23`.

Find the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below .

Input Format

First line contains `T` that denotes the number of test cases.
This is followed by `T` lines, each containing an integer, .

For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `N`.

=== Best Practices

[.lead]
When finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a certain number, there are several best practices you can follow:

1. **Use Arithmetic Progression**: Instead of iterating over each number up to `n`, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression to calculate the sum of multiples of 3 and 5. This will significantly reduce the time complexity of your solution.

2. **Avoid Double Counting**: Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) will be counted twice if you simply sum the multiples of 3 and 5. To avoid this, you should subtract the sum of multiples of 15 from your final result.

3. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: If you choose to generate multiples of 3 and 5, consider using efficient data structures.
For example, a set in Python can store unique elements and has a constant time complexity for checking the presence of an element.

4. **Error Handling**: Always check the validity of the input.
For example, the input should be a positive integer.
If the input is invalid, your function should return an appropriate error message.

5. **Code Readability**: Write your code in a way that is easy to understand.
Use meaningful variable names, add comments where necessary, and follow the style guide of your programming language.

6. **Test Your Code**: Make sure to test your code with different inputs, including edge cases.
For example, test your function with `n` as a small number, a large number, and a multiple of 3 or 5.

=== Use-Cases

[.lead]
Finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a certain number, such as 1000, can have several practical applications in different fields.
Here are a few examples:

1. **Mathematics and Education**: This problem is a common exercise in arithmetic progression and can be used as a teaching tool in mathematics education to help students understand the concept of multiples and summation.

2. **Coding Interviews and Competitions**: This problem is often used in coding interviews and competitions to test a candidate's problem-solving skills and their understanding of time and space complexity.

3. **Simulation and Modeling**: In simulations or modeling scenarios, such a function could be used to generate specific data sets or sequences for testing or analysis.

4. **Game Development**: In game development, such a function could be used in the logic of a game.
For example, a game might award points based on the sum of multiples of certain numbers.

5. **Algorithm Benchmarking**: This problem can also be used to benchmark different algorithms or programming languages in terms of their performance and efficiency.

=== Common Mistakes

[.lead]
When finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a certain number, there are several common mistakes that developers often make:

1. **Double Counting**: One of the most common mistakes is double counting the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15).
If you simply sum the multiples of 3 and 5, you will count these numbers twice.
To avoid this, you should subtract the sum of multiples of 15 from your final result.

2. **Inefficient Iteration**: Another common mistake is to iterate over each number up to `n` to check if it is a multiple of 3 or 5. This is inefficient and can be slow for large values of `n`.
Instead, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression or generate multiples of 3 and 5 using the `range` function with a step parameter.

3. **Ignoring Error Handling**: It's important to check the validity of the input.
The input should be a positive integer.
If the input is invalid, your function should return an appropriate error message.
Ignoring error handling can lead to unexpected results or errors.

4. **Not Testing with Different Inputs**: Make sure to test your code with different inputs, including edge cases.
For example, test your function with `n` as a small number, a large number, and a multiple of 3 or 5. Not testing your code thoroughly can lead to bugs that are hard to detect.

5. **Ignoring Space Complexity**: If you choose to generate multiples of 3 and 5 and store them in a data structure, be aware of the space complexity of your solution.
Creating two sets for multiples of 3 and 5 can consume a significant amount of memory for large values of `n`.

6. **Not Considering Readability**: Code should be written in a way that is easy to understand.
Use meaningful variable names, add comments where necessary, and follow the style guide of your programming language.
Ignoring code readability can make your code hard to maintain and debug.

=== Constraints

stem:[1 <= N <= 10^5] +
stem:[1 <= T <= 10^9]

[source,python,linenums]
----

.Expected Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
23
2318

For `N=10` , if we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get  `3, 5, 6, 9`.
The sum of these multiples is `23`.

Similarly for `N=100`, we get `2318`.
