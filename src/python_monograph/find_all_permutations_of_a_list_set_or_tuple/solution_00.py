def find_all_permutations(data: [list | set | tuple]) -> list[tuple[Any, ...]]:
    """
    Generate all possible permutations of the elements across all lists, sets, or tuples using a brute-force approach.

    This function uses itertools.product to generate all combinations of elements across all lists, and then uses
    itertools.permutations on each combination to generate all permutations.

    Args:
        data (List[List[Any]]): A list of n lists.

    Returns:
        List[List[Any]]: A list of all possible permutations.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list of lists.

    Examples:
        >>> find_all_permutations([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4, 3], [1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2], [1, 4, 2, 3], [1, 4, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3, 4], [2, 1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1], [2, 4, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2, 4], [3, 1, 4, 2], [3, 2, 1, 4], [3, 2, 4, 1], [3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 4, 2, 1], [4, 1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 3, 2], [4, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 3, 1], [4, 3, 1, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1]]
