    This function takes a size in bytes and a notation (either 'decimal' or 'binary') and returns a string
    representing the size in a human-readable format. The 'decimal' notation uses a base of 1000 and the 'binary'
    notation uses a base of 1024.

    Args:
        size (int): The size in bytes to convert.
        notation (str): The notation to use for the conversion. Must be either 'decimal' or 'binary'. Defaults to 'decimal'.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the size in a human-readable format.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the size is negative or the notation is not 'decimal' or 'binary'.
