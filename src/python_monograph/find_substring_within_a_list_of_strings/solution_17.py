def compute_prefix_function(pattern: str) -> list:

    Computes the prefix function for the given pattern. The prefix function is used in the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
    string matching algorithm. It computes, for each position i in the pattern, the length of the longest proper prefix
    of the substring pattern[0..i] which is also a suffix of this substring.

    This function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.
    It iterates over each string in the list, and for each character in the string, it checks if it matches the next character in the pattern.
    If the entire pattern is found in a string, it returns the index of that string in the list.
    If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to search in.
        pattern (str): The pattern to search for.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                     If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the pattern is empty.
