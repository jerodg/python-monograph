def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    """
    This function finds the index of the string that contains the target substring within a list of strings.
    It concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, and then uses the `find()` method to find the target string in the concatenated string.
    If the target string is found, it iterates over the original list of strings to find the index of the first occurrence of the target string.
    If the target string is not found, it returns None.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to be searched.
        target (str): The target string to be searched for.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the string that contains the target substring if found, None otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "hell")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java") is None
        True
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
