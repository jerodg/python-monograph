def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    """
    Search for a target string within a list of strings using a Dynamic Programming approach.

    This function takes a list of strings and a target string as input. It concatenates all the strings in the list into a
    single string, and then uses a Dynamic Programming approach to determine if the target string is a substring of the
    concatenated string. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings,
    and None otherwise.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to be concatenated and used to search for the target string.
        target (str): The target string to be searched in the concatenated string.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings, None otherwise.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "hell")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "pyt")
        2
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java") is None
        True
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
