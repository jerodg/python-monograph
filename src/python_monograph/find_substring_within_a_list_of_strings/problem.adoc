[.lead]
The problem is to find a substring within a list of strings.

You are given a list of strings and a target string.

Your task is to determine if the target string is a substring of any string in the list.

The list of strings can contain any number of strings, and the strings can be of any length.

The target string is a single string of any length.

The function should return an index with the location of the substring if the target string is a substring of any string in the list, and None otherwise.

NOTE: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
For example, 'abc' is a substring of 'abcdef', but 'ace' is not.

== Constraints

The constraints for the problem "Find a Substring Within a List" could be as follows:

1. The list of strings, `lst`, contains `n` strings (1 <= n <= 10^5).
This means the list can contain anywhere from 1 to 100,000 strings.

2. Each string in the list is of length `m` (1 <= m <= 10^5).
This means each string can contain anywhere from 1 to 100,000 characters.

3. The target string is a single string of length `p` (1 <= p <= m).
This means the target string can contain anywhere from 1 to the length of the longest string in the list.

4. The strings can contain any printable ASCII characters.

5. The problem requires case sensitivity, i.e., 'abc' and 'ABC' are considered different strings.

6. The function should return an index with the location of the substring if the target string is a substring of any string in the list, and `None` otherwise.
This means the function should return the first occurrence of the target string in the list.

These constraints are important to understand the boundaries of the problem and to design an efficient solution.

== Examples

=== Example 0

The target string is a substring of one of the strings in the list.

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
lst = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
target = "pyt"
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
2
----

=== Example 1

The target string is not a substring of any string in the list.

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
lst = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
target = "java"
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
None
----

=== Example 2

The target string is a substring of multiple strings in the list.
The function should return the index of the first occurrence.

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
lst = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
target = "o"
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
0
----

=== Example 3

The target string is an empty string.
According to the definition of substring, an empty string is a substring of any string, so the function should return 0.

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
lst = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
target = ""
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
0
----

=== Example 4

The list of strings is empty.
In this case, the function should return None as there are no strings for the target string to be a substring of.

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
lst = []
target = "hello"
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
None
----

== Use-Cases

The problem of finding a substring within a list of strings has several real-world applications.
Here are a few examples:

1. **Search Engines**: Search engines like Google, Bing, etc., need to find a user's query (substring) within a vast amount of data (list of strings).
The solution to this problem can be used to build the core functionality of a search engine.

2. **Text Editors/IDEs**: Text editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) often have a 'Find' or 'Search' feature that allows users to find a specific string within the document or code.
This problem is essentially the same as implementing that feature.

3. **Plagiarism Detection**: In academia or journalism, it's important to detect if a piece of text has been copied from another source.
The solution to this problem can be used to find instances of a specific string (potential plagiarism) within a list of documents.

4. **DNA Sequencing**: In bioinformatics, scientists often need to find a specific sequence of DNA (substring) within a larger DNA sequence (string).
The solution to this problem can be used to build the core functionality of a DNA sequencing software.

5. **Data Mining**: In data mining, it's often necessary to find specific patterns or sequences within a larger dataset.
The solution to this problem can be used to build the core functionality of a data mining algorithm.

== Common Mistakes

When solving the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings, there are several common mistakes that developers often make:

1. **Ignoring Case Sensitivity**: As per the problem statement, the problem requires case sensitivity.
This means 'abc' and 'ABC' are considered different strings.
Ignoring case sensitivity can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Not Handling Empty Strings**: According to the definition of substring, an empty string is a substring of any string.
Therefore, if the target string is an empty string, the function should return 0. Not handling this case can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Not Handling Empty List**: If the list of strings is empty, the function should return `None` as there are no strings for the target string to be a substring of.
Not handling this case can lead to errors or incorrect results.

4. **Returning the Wrong Index**: The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list.
A common mistake is to return the index of the string in which the target string is found, rather than the index of the target string within that string.

5. **Inefficient Solution**: A naive solution might involve checking each string in the list one by one until the target string is found.
This could be very inefficient for large lists.
A more efficient solution would involve using a data structure like a Trie or a string matching algorithm like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) or Boyer-Moore.

6. **Not Considering All Printable ASCII Characters**: The strings can contain any printable ASCII characters.
Not considering all printable ASCII characters can lead to incorrect results.

Avoiding these common mistakes can help in correctly solving the problem and creating an efficient solution.

== Best Practices

When solving the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings, here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Make sure you understand the problem statement and constraints thoroughly before starting to code.
This includes understanding what a substring is and how it differs from a subsequence.

2. **Plan Your Approach**: Before you start coding, plan your approach.
Consider the constraints and think about the best data structures or algorithms to use.
For this problem, a string matching algorithm like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) or Boyer-Moore could be useful.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the list of strings is empty or when the target string is an empty string.

4. **Write Clean Code**: Write your code in a clean and organized manner.
Use meaningful variable names, keep your functions small and focused on a single task, and comment your code to explain what it does.

5. **Optimize Your Solution**: Once you have a working solution, think about how you can optimize it.
For example, you could use a Trie data structure to store the strings and perform the search operation more efficiently.

6. **Test Your Code**: Test your code with different test cases to make sure it works as expected.
This includes both normal cases and edge cases.

7. **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
This will help you understand the efficiency of your code and whether it can handle the maximum constraints.

8. **Follow Python Best Practices**: If you're coding in Python, follow Python best practices.
This includes using list comprehensions where appropriate, using the `in` keyword to check for membership, and using built-in functions and libraries where possible.

9. **Document Your Code**: Finally, document your code.
This includes writing a docstring for your function explaining what it does, its parameters, its return value, and any exceptions it raises.

== Follow-up

After solving the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings, here are some follow-up steps that you could consider:

1. **Optimize Your Solution**: If you haven't already, consider optimizing your solution.
For example, if your current solution is a brute force approach, you could consider using a more efficient string matching algorithm like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) or Boyer-Moore.

2. **Handle Larger Inputs**: Test your solution with larger inputs to ensure it can handle the maximum constraints.
This will help you understand if your solution is efficient enough.

3. **Additional Test Cases**: Write additional test cases to cover edge cases that you might not have considered initially.
This will help ensure your solution is robust.

4. **Code Review**: Consider having your code reviewed by peers.
They might be able to spot potential issues or suggest improvements.

5. **Document Your Code**: If you haven't already, document your code.
This includes writing comments explaining what your code does, its inputs, outputs, and any edge cases or assumptions it makes.
