class SuffixArray:
    """
    A class used to represent a Suffix Array.

    A Suffix Array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It is a simpler and more space-efficient alternative
    to a Suffix Tree, and can be used to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings in constant time.

    Attributes:
        concatenated_string (str): The concatenated string of all input strings, separated by a unique delimiter.
        suffix_hash (set[str]): The set of all suffixes of the concatenated string.

    Methods:
        search(pattern: str) -> bool: Uses hashing to find a pattern in the Suffix Array and returns True if found, False otherwise.

    Doctest:
        >>> sa = SuffixArray(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"])
        >>> sa.find_substring("hell")
        True
        >>> sa.find_substring("java")
        False
        >>> sa.find_substring("o")
        True
        >>> sa.find_substring("")
        True
        >>> sa.find_substring("hello")

        Initialize a SuffixArray object.

        This method takes a list of strings as input and concatenates them into a single string, separating them by a unique
        delimiter that does not appear in the strings. It then generates all the suffixes of the concatenated string and stores
        them in a hash set.

        Args:
            strings (list[str]): The list of strings to be concatenated and used to create the Suffix Array.

        Search for a pattern in the Suffix Array using hashing.

        This method takes a pattern as input and uses hashing to find it in the Suffix Array. It checks if the pattern is in the
        hash set of suffixes. If it is, it returns True. If the pattern is not in the hash set, it returns False.

        Args:
            pattern (str): The pattern to be searched in the Suffix Array.
