def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    """
    This function finds the index of the string that contains the target substring within a list of strings.
    It iterates over each string in the list, and uses the `find()` method to check if the target string is a substring of the current string.
    If the target string is found, it returns the index of the current string. If the target string is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to be searched.
        target (str): The target string to be searched for.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the string that contains the target substring if found, None otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "hell")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java") is None
        True
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: The target string cannot be empty.
        >>> find_substring([], "hello")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: The list of strings cannot be empty.
