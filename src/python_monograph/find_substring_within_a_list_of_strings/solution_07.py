    """
    This function finds a substring within a list of strings using regular expressions and returns the index of the first string
    in the list where the pattern is found as a substring. If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Args:
        strings (List[str]): A list of strings where the pattern is to be searched.
        pattern (str): The target string to be searched as a substring in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        Optional[int]: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                       If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty.

    Examples:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "pyt")
        2
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java") is None
        True
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "")
        0
        >>> find_substring([], "hello")
