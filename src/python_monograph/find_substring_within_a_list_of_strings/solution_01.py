def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    """
    Finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using a naive string matching algorithm.

    This function iterates over each string in the list, and for each string, it iterates over the characters in the string.
    For each character, it checks if the pattern matches the current substring of the string. If the pattern is found,
    it returns the index of the string in the list. If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to search in.
        target (str): The pattern to search for.

    Returns:
        Union[int, None]: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                          If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "pyt")
        2
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java") is None
        True
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
        0
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: The target string cannot be empty.
        >>> find_substring([], "hello")
        Traceback (most recent call last):

        ValueError: The list of strings cannot be empty.
