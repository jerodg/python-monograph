    Check if the target string is a substring of the chunk.

    This function takes a chunk of the concatenated string and the target string as input. It checks if the target string
    is a substring of the chunk and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the chunk if it is,
    and None otherwise.

    Args:
        chunk (str): The chunk of the concatenated string to be checked.
        target (str): The target string to be searched in the chunk.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first occurrence of the target string in the chunk if it is a substring, None otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> worker("hello#world", "hell")

    Search for a target string within a list of strings using a Parallel Computing approach.

    This function takes a list of strings and a target string as input. It uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to process each string
    in the list in parallel, and calls the worker function on each string. If the worker function returns a non-None result
    for any string, the function immediately returns the index of that string in the list. If the worker function returns
    None for all strings, the function returns None.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to be processed.
        target (str): The target string to be searched in the strings.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first string in the list that contains the target string as a substring, or None if
        no such string is found.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "hell")
