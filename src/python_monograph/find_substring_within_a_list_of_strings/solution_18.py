def compute_bad_char_table(pattern: str) -> dict:

    Computes the bad character table for the given pattern. The bad character table is used in the Boyer-Moore
    string matching algorithm. It computes, for each character in the pattern, the last occurrence of that character.

    Args:

    Returns:
        dict: The bad character table for the given pattern.

def find_substring(strings: list[str], pattern: str) -> int | None:
    """
    This function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
    The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a string searching algorithm that finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a text in linear time.
    It uses a bad character heuristic to skip sections of the text, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string
    algorithms in practice.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to search in.
        pattern (str): The pattern to search for.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                     If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the pattern is empty.
