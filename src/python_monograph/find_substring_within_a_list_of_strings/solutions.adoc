== Approaches

There are several techniques, approaches, or methodologies that can be used to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings:

1. **Brute Force**: The simplest approach is to iterate over each string in the list and check if the target string is a substring of the current string.
This can be done using the built-in substring search functionality in many programming languages.
However, this approach can be inefficient for large lists or long strings.

2. **Naive String Matching Algorithm**: The Naive String Matching Algorithm is a simple algorithm that compares the target string with each substring of each string in the list.
This approach is similar to the brute force approach, but can be more efficient in some cases.

3. **Trie Data Structure**: A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that allows for efficient substring searching.
Each node in the Trie represents a character, and each path from the root to a node represents a string.
This can be used to check if the target string is a substring of any string in the list.

4. **Suffix Tree Data Structure**: A Suffix Tree is a compressed Trie that contains all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values.
It can be used to solve this problem in linear time.

5. **Suffix Array Data Structure**: A Suffix Array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string.
It is a simpler and more space-efficient alternative to a Suffix Tree, and can also be used to solve this problem in linear time.

6. **Binary Search**: If the list of strings is sorted, a binary search can be used to find the target string.
This approach is more efficient than a brute force search, but requires the list to be sorted.

7. **Hashing**: Hashing can be used to store the strings in the list in a hash table, allowing for constant time searching.
However, this approach requires additional space to store the hash table.

8. **Regular Expressions**: Regular expressions can be used to find substrings within strings.
They are a powerful tool for string manipulation and can be used to solve this problem.

9. **Dynamic Programming**: Dynamic programming can be used to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.

10. **Parallel Computing**: If the list of strings is very large, the problem can be divided into smaller parts and solved in parallel.
This can significantly reduce the time required to find the substring.

11. **Using the in Operator**: The in operator can be used to check if the target string is a substring of any string in the list.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

12. **Using the any() Method**: The any() method can be used to check if the target string is a substring of any string in the list.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

13. **Using the find() Method**: The find() method can be used to find the index of the target string within each string in the list.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

14. **Using the find() Method With a List-Comprehension**: The find() method can be used with a list-comprehension to find the index of the target string within each string in the list.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

15. **Using the join() Method**: The join() method can be used to concatenate all the strings in the list into a single string, and then use the find() method to find the target string.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

16. **Using a for-loop**: A for-loop can be used to iterate over each string in the list and check if the target string is a substring of the current string.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

17. **Using a list-comprehension**: A list-comprehension can be used to iterate over each string in the list and check if the target string is a substring of the current string.
This is a simple and efficient approach, but may not be suitable for large lists or long strings.

18. **Using Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm**: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text in linear time.
It can be used to solve this problem efficiently.

19. **Using Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: The Boyer-Moore Algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text in linear time.
It can be used to solve this problem efficiently.

20. **Using the Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: The Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text in linear time.
It can be used to solve this problem efficiently.

Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best one to use depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.

== Performance Optimizations

Here are some tips for optimizing the performance of a Python function that solves the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings:

1. **Use Efficient Algorithms**: Use efficient string matching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-Moore, or Rabin-Karp.
These algorithms can find a substring within a string in linear time, which is much faster than the naive approach.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Computations**: If the target string is found, you can immediately return the index instead of continuing to check the remaining strings.

3. **Use Built-in Functions**: Python's built-in functions are usually optimized for performance.
For example, you can use the `in` operator to check if a string is a substring of another string.

4. **Use Data Structures**: Data structures like Trie or Suffix Tree can be used to store the strings and perform the search operation more efficiently.

5. **Parallel Computing**: If the list of strings is very large, the problem can be divided into smaller parts and solved in parallel.
This can significantly reduce the time required to find the substring.

6. **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage.
Large data structures can consume a lot of memory, which can slow down your program or even cause it to crash if memory is limited.

7. **Code Optimization**: Optimize your Python code by using list comprehensions, generator expressions, and other Pythonic constructs that can lead to faster execution times.

8. **Profiling**: Use Python's built-in profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your code.
This can help you focus your optimization efforts where they will have the most impact.

Remember, the key to optimization is measuring.
Always test the performance of your code before and after optimization to ensure that your changes are having the desired effect.

== Solutions

=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `find_substring` that takes two arguments: `strings` and `target`. The `strings` argument is expected to be a list of strings, and `target` is a single string. The function is designed to find the first occurrence of the `target` within the list of `strings`.

The function begins by checking if the `strings` list is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "The list of strings cannot be empty." This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
----

Next, the function checks if the `target` string is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "The target string cannot be empty." This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

The function then iterates over each string in the `strings` list using a `for` loop. For each string, it checks if the `target` is found within the string using the `in` operator. If the `target` is found, the function immediately returns the index of the current string in the list. This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
for index, string in enumerate(strings):
    if target in string:
        return index
----

If the function iterates over all the strings in the list without finding the `target`, it returns `None`. This indicates that the `target` was not found in any string in the list. This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
return None
----

The function also includes a docstring with doctests that provide examples of how the function can be used. The doctests can be run using the `doctest` module in Python to verify the correctness of the function.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a brute force approach to find a substring within a list of strings. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of this method:

Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses built-in Python features like the `in` operator and `enumerate` function, making it accessible for developers at all levels.
2. **No Additional Space**: This approach does not require any additional data structures, so it uses minimal extra space.
3. **Early Exit**: The function returns as soon as it finds the first occurrence of the target string, which can save time when the target string is found early in the list.

Disadvantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings. This could be inefficient for large lists or long strings.
2. **Scalability**: For very large lists or strings, this method may be slow and could be improved by using more advanced data structures or algorithms, such as a Trie or a string matching algorithm like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The current implementation is case-sensitive, which might not be desirable in all situations. If case-insensitive matching is required, the code would need to be adjusted.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the provided code is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the code needs to iterate over each character in each string in the list to find the target substring.

The space complexity of the code is O(1). This is because the space used does not increase with the size of the input list. The variables used in the function (strings, target, index, and string) do not take up additional space that scales with the size of the input.

==== Code Review

The code provided is a Python function `find_substring` that finds the first occurrence of a target string within a list of strings. Here's a review based on the best practices you mentioned:

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is quite readable. It uses descriptive variable names like `strings` and `target`, and the function name `find_substring` clearly describes what the function does. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow.

2. **Maintainability**: The function is simple and does not seem to be tightly coupled with other systems or configurations, which is good for maintainability. However, if the requirements change in the future (for example, if we need to find all occurrences of the target string), modifications would be needed.

3. **Security**: As this function only performs string operations, there are no apparent security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The function uses a brute force approach, which has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of the strings. This could be inefficient for large inputs. More efficient algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore could be considered for performance improvement.

5. **Documentation**: The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and exceptions. It also includes doctests that provide examples of how the function can be used.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The function uses Python's built-in `enumerate` and `in` operator, which is good. It does not seem to reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The function handles edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty by raising a `ValueError`. This is a good practice as it makes the function's behavior more predictable.

8. **Scalability**: As mentioned in the Speed and Performance section, the function's current implementation may not scale well for large inputs due to its time complexity.

9. **Reusability**: The function is general-purpose and can be reused in different contexts where a substring needs to be found within a list of strings.

10. **Patterns**: The code follows Python's standard conventions and style guide (PEP 8).

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: The function includes doctests, but for comprehensive test coverage, additional unit tests should be written using a testing framework like `pytest`. These tests should cover various edge cases and input types.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The function appears to meet its intended purpose of finding the first occurrence of a target string within a list of strings.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of strings or a string. Type checking could be added to handle such scenarios.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using a brute force method to solve the problem is simple and straightforward. However, for large inputs, a more efficient string matching algorithm could be considered.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python function, `find_substring`, is designed to find the first occurrence of a target string within a list of strings. It uses a naive string matching algorithm to accomplish this.

The function takes two arguments: `strings` and `target`. The `strings` argument is a list of strings in which the function will search for the `target` string. The `target` argument is the string that the function is trying to find within the `strings` list.

The function starts by checking if the `strings` list or the `target` string is empty. If either is empty, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. This is done using the following code snippets:

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
----

[source,python]
----
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

Next, the function iterates over each string in the `strings` list using a `for` loop. For each string, it iterates over the characters in the string. For each character, it checks if the `target` matches the current substring of the string. If the `target` is found, it returns the index of the string in the list. This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
for index, string in enumerate(strings):
    for i in range(len(string) - len(target) + 1):
        if string[i:i + len(target)] == target:
            return index
----

If the function iterates over all the strings in the list without finding the `target`, it returns `None`. This indicates that the `target` was not found in any string in the list. This is done using the following code snippet:

[source,python]
----
return None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function uses a naive string matching algorithm to find the first occurrence of a target string within a list of strings. It handles edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty by raising a `ValueError`. If the target string is found, it returns the index of the string in the list. If the target string is not found, it returns `None`.

=== Solution 02

A Trie Node, short for retrieval tree or prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings or sequences of characters. Each node in a Trie represents a single character of the string. The root node typically represents an empty string, and each subsequent level in the tree represents characters added to the string.

Here are the key components of a Trie Node:

. *Children*: Each node can have multiple children, representing the next character in the sequence. The children are usually stored in an array or a hashmap, where the key is the character and the value is the reference to the child node.
. *End of Word Marker*: A flag indicating whether the current node represents the end of a word. This is essential for searching and determining if a string exists in the Trie.
. *Count/Value*: Optionally, each node may contain additional information such as a count (indicating the number of times a word appears) or a value associated with the word.

Trie Nodes are particularly useful for tasks like:

* *Prefix Matching*: Quickly finding all strings that start with a given prefix.
* *Auto-completion*: Generating suggestions based on partial input.
* *Spell Checking*: Efficiently detecting misspelled words.
* *Dictionary Implementation*: Storing and looking up words efficiently.

Here's a simple example of a Trie Node structure:

[source]
----
          root
          /  \
         c    a
         |    |
         a    r
         |    |
         t    t
         |    |
        end  end
----

In this example, we have stored two words: "cat" and "car". The Trie starts with the root node and each subsequent level represents the characters in the words. The 'end' marker denotes the end of a word.

Overall, Trie Nodes offer fast retrieval and insertion times for strings, making them a popular choice for various string-related algorithms and applications.


==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided code is written in Python and it implements a Trie data structure to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings.

The code consists of two classes: `TrieNode` and `Trie`, and a function `find_substring`.

The `TrieNode` class represents a node in the Trie. Each `TrieNode` object has two attributes: `children` and `end_of_string`. `children` is a dictionary that maps each character in the alphabet to the next `TrieNode` in the Trie that the character leads to. `end_of_string` is a boolean value that is `True` if this node marks the end of a string in the Trie, and `False` otherwise.

[source,python]
----
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_of_string = False
----

The `Trie` class represents the Trie data structure itself. It has a single attribute, `root`, which is the root node of the Trie. The `Trie` class also has two methods: `insert` and `search`. The `insert` method takes a word as input and inserts it into the Trie. The `search` method takes a word as input and searches for it in the Trie. If the word is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.end_of_string = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.end_of_string
----

The `find_substring` function uses the `Trie` class to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings. It creates a Trie and inserts all the strings from the list into the Trie. Then it searches for the pattern in the Trie. If the pattern is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `None`.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list, target: str) -> [int | None]:
    if not strings:
        raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
    if not target:
        raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
    trie = Trie()
    for string in strings:
        trie.insert(string)
    return trie.search(target)
----

In summary, this code provides an efficient way to search for a substring within a list of strings by using a Trie data structure. The Trie is built by inserting all the strings from the list, and then the target substring is searched in the Trie.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a Trie data structure for finding a substring within a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: Tries are highly efficient for searching words or prefixes. They can search, insert, and delete words in O(L) time complexity, where L is the length of the word. This is faster than other data structures like arrays, linked lists, or binary search trees for string operations.
2. **Prefix Matching**: Tries are excellent for prefix matching problems. They can quickly find all words that start with a given prefix.
3. **Auto-Completion**: Tries are used in auto-completion features of search engines or text editors. They can quickly suggest possible word completions based on partial queries.
4. **Space Optimization**: Tries can be space-optimized using techniques like path compression, which merges nodes that are univocal (i.e., nodes having a single child).

Disadvantages:
1. **Space Consumption**: Tries can consume a lot of memory. Each node can contain a reference for every character in the alphabet, which can be space-consuming, especially for large alphabets.
2. **Complexity**: Tries are more complex data structures compared to arrays, linked lists, or binary search trees. Implementing and understanding them can be more challenging.
3. **Slower for Small Datasets**: For small datasets, the overhead of Trie data structure might make operations slower compared to simple data structures like arrays or linked lists.

In the context of the provided code, the Trie data structure is used to efficiently find a substring within a list of strings. The Trie is built by inserting all the strings from the list, and then the target substring is searched in the Trie. This approach is efficient for large lists of strings and long substrings. However, it might be less efficient for small lists or short substrings due to the overhead of building the Trie.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Time Complexity**:

   - The `insert` method in the `Trie` class has a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the word being inserted. This is because it iterates over each character in the word once.

   - The `search` method in the `Trie` class also has a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the word being searched. Similar to the `insert` method, it iterates over each character in the word once.

   - The `find_substring` function has a time complexity of O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings. This is because it calls the `insert` method for each string in the list, and then calls the `search` method once for the target string.

2. **Space Complexity**:

   - The space complexity of the `Trie` class is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the average length of the strings. This is because each node in the Trie can have up to M children (one for each character in the alphabet), and there can be up to N * M nodes in the Trie (one for each character in each string).

   - The `find_substring` function has a space complexity of O(N * M) as well, because it creates a Trie that stores all the strings from the list.

In summary, the provided code has a time complexity of O(N * M) and a space complexity of O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

==== Code Review

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It's broken down into small, manageable chunks (methods and classes), and uses descriptive variable and function names. The use of docstrings for classes and methods enhances readability.

2. **Maintainability**: The code is easy to extend and change. The separation of concerns is clear with different classes for Trie and TrieNode, and different methods for different operations.

3. **Security**: As this code doesn't deal with any sensitive data or network operations, there are no apparent security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The use of a Trie data structure for string matching is an efficient choice. However, the `search` method could be optimized by returning as soon as the end of a string is found, instead of checking all characters.

5. **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods. However, a README file explaining the overall purpose and usage of the code would be beneficial.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The code leverages Python's built-in features and doesn't seem to reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The code handles edge cases like empty strings and empty lists. However, it could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

8. **Scalability**: The Trie data structure scales well for large inputs. However, the memory usage could be high for large datasets due to the nature of Trie.

9. **Reusability**: The `Trie` and `TrieNode` classes are reusable for other string matching problems.

10. **Patterns**: The code adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide and uses appropriate Python idioms.

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: The code includes doctests, but it would be beneficial to add more comprehensive unit tests to cover edge cases and error scenarios.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The code provides the intended functionality of finding a substring within a list of strings.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The code could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using a Trie for string matching is appropriate and efficient. However, the memory usage could be high for large datasets due to the nature of Trie.

=== Solution 03

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_03.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided code is written in Python and it implements a Suffix Tree data structure to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings.

The code consists of two classes: `Node` and `SuffixTree`, and a function `find_substring`.

The `Node` class represents a node in the Suffix Tree. Each `Node` object has two attributes: `children` and `end_of_string`. `children` is a dictionary that maps each character in the alphabet to the next `Node` in the tree that the character leads to. `end_of_string` is a boolean value that is `True` if this node marks the end of a string in the tree, and `False` otherwise.

[source,python]
----
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_of_string = False
----

The `SuffixTree` class represents the Suffix Tree data structure itself. It has a single attribute, `root`, which is the root node of the tree. The `SuffixTree` class also has two methods: `insert` and `search`. The `insert` method takes a word as input and inserts it and all its suffixes into the tree. The `search` method takes a pattern as input and searches for it in the tree. If the pattern is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
class SuffixTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = Node()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            self._insert(word[i:])

    def _insert(self, suffix: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in suffix:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = Node()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.end_of_string = True

    def search(self, pattern: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in pattern:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
----

The `find_substring` function uses the `SuffixTree` class to solve the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings. It creates a Suffix Tree and inserts all the strings from the list into the tree. Then it searches for the pattern in the tree. If the pattern is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list, pattern: str) -> [int | None]:
    tree = SuffixTree()
    for string in strings:
        tree.insert(string)
    return tree.search(pattern)
----

In summary, this code provides an efficient way to search for a substring within a list of strings by using a Suffix Tree data structure. The Suffix Tree is built by inserting all the strings from the list, and then the target substring is searched in the tree.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a Suffix Tree data structure for finding a substring within a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: Suffix Trees are highly efficient for searching substrings. They can search, insert, and delete substrings in O(L) time complexity, where L is the length of the substring. This is faster than other data structures like arrays, linked lists, or binary search trees for string operations.
2. **Suffix Matching**: Suffix Trees are excellent for suffix matching problems. They can quickly find all strings that end with a given suffix.
3. **Space Optimization**: Suffix Trees can be space-optimized using techniques like path compression, which merges nodes that are univocal (i.e., nodes having a single child).

Disadvantages:
1. **Space Consumption**: Suffix Trees can consume a lot of memory. Each node can contain a reference for every character in the alphabet, which can be space-consuming, especially for large alphabets.
2. **Complexity**: Suffix Trees are more complex data structures compared to arrays, linked lists, or binary search trees. Implementing and understanding them can be more challenging.
3. **Slower for Small Datasets**: For small datasets, the overhead of Suffix Tree data structure might make operations slower compared to simple data structures like arrays or linked lists.

In the context of the provided code, the Suffix Tree data structure is used to efficiently find a substring within a list of strings. The Suffix Tree is built by inserting all the strings from the list, and then the target substring is searched in the Suffix Tree. This approach is efficient for large lists of strings and long substrings. However, it might be less efficient for small lists or short substrings due to the overhead of building the Suffix Tree.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Time Complexity**:

   - The `insert` method in the `SuffixTree` class has a time complexity of O(L^2), where L is the length of the word being inserted. This is because it iterates over each character in the word once and for each character, it calls the `_insert` method which again iterates over the remaining characters in the word.

   - The `search` method in the `SuffixTree` class has a time complexity of O(P), where P is the length of the pattern being searched. This is because it iterates over each character in the pattern once.

   - The `find_substring` function has a time complexity of O(N * M^2 + P), where N is the number of strings in the list, M is the average length of the strings, and P is the length of the pattern. This is because it calls the `insert` method for each string in the list, and then calls the `search` method once for the pattern.

2. **Space Complexity**:

   - The space complexity of the `SuffixTree` class is O(N * M^2), where N is the number of strings and M is the average length of the strings. This is because each node in the Suffix Tree can have up to M children (one for each character in the alphabet), and there can be up to N * M^2 nodes in the Suffix Tree (one for each character in each string and its suffixes).

   - The `find_substring` function has a space complexity of O(N * M^2) as well, because it creates a Suffix Tree that stores all the strings and their suffixes from the list.

In summary, the provided code has a time complexity of O(N * M^2 + P) and a space complexity of O(N * M^2), where N is the number of strings in the list, M is the average length of the strings, and P is the length of the pattern.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The code provides the intended functionality of finding a substring within a list of strings.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The code could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using a Suffix Tree for string matching is appropriate and efficient. However, the memory usage could be high for large datasets due to the nature of Suffix Tree.

=== Solution 04

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_04.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a class called `SuffixArray` which is used to find a substring within a list of strings in linear time. This is achieved by creating a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, which is a simpler and more space-efficient alternative to a Suffix Tree.

The `SuffixArray` class has two attributes: `concatenated_string` and `suffix_array`. The `concatenated_string` is a single string that is created by concatenating all input strings, separated by a unique delimiter. The `suffix_array` is a sorted array of all suffixes of the `concatenated_string`.

[source,python]
----
self.concatenated_string = '#'.join(strings)
self.suffix_array = sorted([self.concatenated_string[i:] for i in range(len(self.concatenated_string))])
----

The `SuffixArray` class has two methods: `__init__` and `find_substring`. The `__init__` method is used to initialize a `SuffixArray` object. It takes a list of strings as input, concatenates them into a single string, generates all the suffixes of the concatenated string, and sorts them to create the `suffix_array`.

The `find_substring` method is used to search for a pattern in the `suffix_array`. It takes a pattern as input and iterates over each suffix in the `suffix_array`. If the pattern is a prefix of the current suffix, it returns `True`. If the pattern is not a prefix of any suffix in the `suffix_array`, it returns `False`.

[source,python]
----
for suffix in self.suffix_array:
    if suffix.startswith(pattern):
        return True
return False
----

The `SuffixArray` class also includes doctests for both the `__init__` and `find_substring` methods to ensure they are working as expected.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is the creation of a Suffix Array to find a substring within a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The Suffix Array is a more space-efficient alternative to a Suffix Tree. It uses less memory because it only needs to store the starting positions of the suffixes in the original string, rather than storing the suffixes themselves.
2. **Speed**: The Suffix Array allows for fast substring search. Once the Suffix Array is sorted, binary search can be used to find a substring in O(log n) time.
3. **Simplicity**: The Suffix Array is simpler to implement than a Suffix Tree. It doesn't require complex data structures or algorithms.

Disadvantages:
1. **Preprocessing Time**: The creation of the Suffix Array requires sorting all the suffixes of the concatenated string, which takes O(n log n) time. This can be slow for large inputs.
2. **Space Complexity**: Although the Suffix Array is more space-efficient than a Suffix Tree, it still requires O(n) space to store the starting positions of the suffixes. This can be high for large inputs.
3. **Limited Functionality**: The Suffix Array only supports substring search. It doesn't support more complex operations like finding the longest common prefix or suffix, which can be done with a Suffix Tree.

In conclusion, the Suffix Array is a powerful tool for substring search, but its usefulness may be limited by its preprocessing time and space complexity, especially for large inputs.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Time Complexity**:

   - The `__init__` method: The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, which is O(n log n), where n is the length of the concatenated string. The generation of all suffixes is O(n), but this is overshadowed by the sorting operation.

   - The `find_substring` method: The time complexity is O(m * n), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the number of suffixes in the suffix array. This is because, in the worst case, the method might need to iterate over all the suffixes and for each suffix, it checks if the pattern is a prefix of the suffix, which takes O(m) time.

2. **Space Complexity**:

   - The space complexity of the `SuffixArray` class is O(n), where n is the length of the concatenated string. This is because the class stores the concatenated string and the suffix array, both of which have a length proportional to n.

Please note that these complexities are worst-case scenarios and actual performance may vary depending on the specific inputs and Python's internal optimizations.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the concatenated string. This is because the Suffix Array stores all the suffixes of the concatenated string.

=== Solution 07

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_07.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `find_substring` that searches for a substring within a list of strings and returns the index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found. If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns `None`.

The function takes two arguments: `strings`, which is a list of strings where the pattern is to be searched, and `pattern`, which is the target string to be searched as a substring in the list of strings.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list[str], pattern: str) -> int | None:
----

The function starts by checking if the list of strings is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
----

Then, the function iterates over each string in the list. For each string, it uses the `re.search` function from the `re` module to search for the pattern in the current string. If the pattern is found, it returns the index of the string.

[source,python]
----
for i, string in enumerate(strings):
    if re.search(pattern, string):
        return i
----

If the pattern is not found in any string after iterating through the entire list, the function returns `None`.

[source,python]
----
return None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function provides a way to find a substring within a list of strings by leveraging Python's built-in `re` module for regular expression matching. It returns the index of the first string where the pattern is found, or `None` if the pattern is not found in any string.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is the use of regular expressions to find a substring within a list of strings. This method has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for string manipulation. They can be used to find substrings within strings in a simple and straightforward way.

2. **Flexibility**: Regular expressions provide a lot of flexibility. They can match complex patterns and can handle a wide range of string manipulation tasks.

3. **Speed**: Regular expressions are implemented in C in most Python distributions, which makes them quite fast for searching patterns in strings.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Complexity**: While regular expressions are powerful, they can also be complex and hard to understand, especially for complex patterns. This can make the code harder to read and maintain.

2. **Performance**: Regular expressions can be slow if not used properly. For example, using a regular expression to search for a pattern in a very long string or a large number of strings can be slow.

3. **Limited Use Case**: The method used in the code only returns the index of the first string where the pattern is found. If the pattern is found in multiple strings, this method won't return all the indices.

In the provided code, the `find_substring` function uses regular expressions to find a substring within a list of strings. It returns the index of the first string where the pattern is found, or `None` if the pattern is not found in any string. This method is simple and flexible, but it may be slow for large inputs and it doesn't return all indices if the pattern is found in multiple strings.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the loop that iterates over each string in the list and the `re.search` operation within the loop.

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each string in the list, so its time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

2. **Regular Expression Search (`re.search`)**: The `re.search` function performs a regular expression search for the pattern in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the string.

Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input list and pattern, and a few variables for iteration and pattern matching. The space usage does not grow with the size of the input list or strings.

==== Code Review

Based on the provided Python code and the best practices you mentioned, here's a code review:

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It's broken down into small, manageable chunks (methods), and uses descriptive variable and function names. The use of docstrings for the function enhances readability.

2. **Maintainability**: The code is easy to extend and change. The separation of concerns is clear with different sections for input validation, pattern searching, and result returning.

3. **Security**: As this code doesn't deal with any sensitive data or network operations, there are no apparent security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The use of regular expressions for string matching is an efficient choice. However, the `find_substring` method could be optimized by returning as soon as the pattern is found, instead of checking all strings.

5. **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with a comprehensive docstring for the function explaining what it does, its parameters, its return value, and any exceptions it raises.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The code leverages Python's built-in features and doesn't seem to reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The code handles edge cases like empty strings and empty lists. However, it could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

8. **Scalability**: The regular expression search scales well for large inputs. However, the performance could be slow for large datasets due to the nature of regular expressions.

9. **Reusability**: The `find_substring` function is reusable for other string matching problems.

10. **Patterns**: The code adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide and uses appropriate Python idioms.

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: The code includes doctests, but it would be beneficial to add more comprehensive unit tests to cover edge cases and error scenarios.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The code provides the intended functionality of finding a substring within a list of strings.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The code could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using regular expressions for string matching is appropriate and efficient. However, the performance could be slow for large datasets due to the nature of regular expressions.

=== Solution 08

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_08.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `find_substring` that searches for a target string within a list of strings and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list. If the target string is not found, it returns `None`.

The function takes two arguments: `strings`, which is a list of strings to be concatenated and used to search for the target string, and `target`, which is the target string to be searched in the concatenated string.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
----

The function starts by checking if the list of strings or the target string is empty. If either is, it raises a `ValueError`.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

Then, the function concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, separating them by a unique delimiter `#`.

[source,python]
----
concatenated_string = '#'.join(strings)
----

Next, the function initializes a 2D boolean array `dp` with `False`. This array is used to keep track of whether the substring from index `i` to `j` in the concatenated string is equal to the target string.

[source,python]
----
dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
----

The function then iterates over the concatenated string and the target string, updating the `dp` array based on whether the substring from index `i` to `j` in the concatenated string is equal to the target string.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(n):
    if target and concatenated_string[i] == target[0]:
        dp[i][i] = True
for length in range(2, m + 1):
    for i in range(n - length + 1):
        j = i + length - 1
        if concatenated_string[i:j + 1] == target:
            dp[i][j] = True
----

Finally, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings, or `None` if the target string is not found.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(n - m + 1):
    if dp[i][i + m - 1]:
        return concatenated_string[:i].count('#')
return None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function uses a Dynamic Programming approach to find a target string within a list of strings. It concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, and then checks if the target string is a substring of the concatenated string. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings, or `None` if the target string is not found.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to find a substring within a list of strings. This method has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Efficiency**: The DP approach is efficient as it reduces the problem to smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, thereby avoiding redundant computations.

2. **Optimization**: DP is an optimization method that can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem. In this case, it is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings.

3. **Memory Usage**: The DP approach uses a 2D boolean array to keep track of whether the substring from index `i` to `j` in the concatenated string is equal to the target string. This can be more memory-efficient than other methods that might require storing all possible substrings.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Memory Usage**: Despite being more memory-efficient than some methods, the DP approach can still consume a significant amount of memory for large inputs due to the use of a 2D array.

2. **Complexity**: The DP approach can be more complex to understand and implement than some other methods. It requires a good understanding of the problem and careful design to ensure that all subproblems are covered and combined correctly.

3. **Overhead**: The DP approach has an overhead of setting up the DP table and maintaining it. For smaller inputs or simpler problems, this overhead might not be justified, and simpler or more direct methods could be faster.

In the provided code, the `find_substring` function uses a DP approach to find a target string within a list of strings. It concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string, and then checks if the target string is a substring of the concatenated string. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the list of strings, or `None` if the target string is not found.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the two nested loops that iterate over the concatenated string and the target string.

1. **First Loop Iteration**: The first loop iterates over each character in the concatenated string, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the concatenated string.

2. **Second Loop Iteration**: The second loop is a nested loop that iterates over the length of the target string and the length of the concatenated string. Therefore, its time complexity is O(m * n), where m is the length of the target string and n is the length of the concatenated string.

Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(n + m * n), which simplifies to O(m * n).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the 2D boolean array `dp` that is used to keep track of whether the substring from index `i` to `j` in the concatenated string is equal to the target string.

The `dp` array has n rows and n columns, where n is the length of the concatenated string. Therefore, it takes O(n^2) space.

In addition, the function uses a constant amount of space to store the input list, target string, and a few variables for iteration and pattern matching. However, this space usage does not grow with the size of the input list or strings, so it is considered to be O(1), or constant space.

Therefore, the overall space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(n^2).

2. **Maintainability**: The code is easy to extend and change. The separation of concerns is clear with different classes for `SuffixArray` and different methods for different operations.

3. **Security**: As this code doesn't deal with any sensitive data or network operations, there are no apparent security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The use of a Suffix Array and a hash set for string matching is an efficient choice. However, the `find_substring` method could be optimized by returning as soon as the pattern is found in the hash set, instead of checking all suffixes.

5. **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods. However, a README file explaining the overall purpose and usage of the code would be beneficial.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The code leverages Python's built-in features and doesn't seem to reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The code handles edge cases like empty strings and empty lists. However, it could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

=== Solution 09

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_09.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines two functions, `worker` and `find_substring`, which are used to find a target string within a list of strings using a parallel computing approach.

The `worker` function takes a chunk of the concatenated string and the target string as input. It checks if the target string is a substring of the chunk and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target string in the chunk if it is, and `None` otherwise.

[source,python]
----
def worker(chunk: str, target: str) -> int | None:
    if not target:
        raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
    if target in chunk:
        return chunk.index(target)
    return None
----

The `find_substring` function takes a list of strings and a target string as input. It uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process each string in the list in parallel, and calls the `worker` function on each string. If the `worker` function returns a non-`None` result for any string, the function immediately returns the index of that string in the list. If the `worker` function returns `None` for all strings, the function returns `None`.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    if not strings:
        raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
    if not target:
        raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(worker, strings[i], target) for i in range(len(strings))]
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            if future.result() is not None:
                return futures.index(future)
    return None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function uses a parallel computing approach to find a target string within a list of strings. It splits the list of strings into chunks, and then checks each chunk in parallel to see if the target string is a substring. The function returns the index of the first string in the list that contains the target string as a substring, or `None` if no such string is found.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a parallel computing approach to find a substring within a list of strings. This method has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Efficiency**: The parallel computing approach is efficient as it processes each string in the list in parallel, which can significantly reduce the time required to find the target string, especially for large lists of strings.

2. **Scalability**: This method scales well with the number of processor cores. The more cores available, the more strings can be processed in parallel.

3. **Concurrency**: The use of Python's `concurrent.futures` module allows for easy management of concurrent tasks, including starting tasks, collecting results, and handling exceptions.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Overhead**: The parallel computing approach has an overhead of setting up the thread pool and managing the threads. For smaller inputs or simpler problems, this overhead might not be justified, and a simpler or more direct method could be faster.

2. **Complexity**: The parallel computing approach can be more complex to understand and implement than some other methods. It requires a good understanding of concurrent programming and careful design to ensure that all tasks are managed correctly.

3. **Non-deterministic Results**: Due to the nature of concurrent execution, the order in which strings are processed can vary between runs, which can lead to non-deterministic results. In this case, if the target string is found in multiple strings in the list, the function might return different results for different runs.

In the provided code, the `find_substring` function uses a parallel computing approach to find a target string within a list of strings. It splits the list of strings into chunks, and then checks each chunk in parallel to see if the target string is a substring. The function returns the index of the first string in the list that contains the target string as a substring, or `None` if no such string is found.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

1. **worker function**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the chunk. This is because the function checks if the target string is a substring of the chunk, which takes O(n) time.

2. **find_substring function**: The time complexity is O(m), where m is the number of strings in the list. This is because the function processes each string in the list in parallel. However, in the worst-case scenario where the ThreadPoolExecutor can only run one task at a time, the time complexity would be O(m * n), where n is the average length of the strings in the list.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the provided code is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because the functions only use a fixed amount of space to store the input list, target string, and a few variables for iteration and pattern matching. The space usage does not grow with the size of the input list or strings.

2. **No Preprocessing**: This method does not require any preprocessing of the input list or target string, which can save time and space for large inputs.

3. **Early Termination**: The function returns as soon as the target string is found, which can save time if the target string is found early in the list.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Efficiency**: The linear search approach has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m is the number of strings in the list and n is the average length of the strings. This can be slow for large inputs.

2. **No Parallelism**: This method processes each string in the list sequentially, which does not take advantage of potential parallelism for multi-core processors.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: The 'in' operator in Python is case sensitive, which means that the function will not find the target string if the case of the characters differs. This could be a disadvantage if case-insensitive search is required.

=== Solution 11

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_11.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `find_substring` that is used to find a target string within a list of strings. The function takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `target`, which is the string to be found.

The function begins by checking if the list of strings or the target string is empty. If either is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

The main logic of the function uses Python's built-in `any()` function in combination with a generator expression. The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one element of an iterable is `True`, and `False` otherwise. The generator expression `(target in x for x in strings)` generates a sequence of `True` or `False` values, depending on whether the target string is a substring of each string in the list.

[source,python]
----
return any(target in x for x in strings)
----

In this case, the `any()` function will return `True` if the target string is a substring of at least one string in the list, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the `find_substring` function will return `True` if the target string is found within the list of strings, and `False` otherwise.

In summary, the `find_substring` function is used to find a target string within a list of strings. It raises an error if the list of strings or the target string is empty, and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the target string is a substring of at least one string in the list.

=== Solution 12

==== Implementation

----
include::./solution_12.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `find_substring` that is used to find a target string within a list of strings. The function takes two parameters: `strings`, which is a list of strings, and `target`, which is the string to be found.

The function begins by checking if the list of strings or the target string is empty. If either is empty, it raises a `ValueError`.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

The main logic of the function uses Python's built-in `enumerate()` function in combination with a for loop. The `enumerate()` function is used to loop over the list of strings and it returns both the index and the value of each item.

[source,python]
----
for i, string in enumerate(strings):
----

Inside the loop, the `find()` method is used to check if the target string is a substring of the current string. The `find()` method returns the index of the start of the substring if found, and `-1` otherwise. If the target string is found, the function returns the index of the current string in the list.

[source,python]
----
if string.find(target) != -1:
    return i
----

If the target string is not found in any string in the list, the function returns `None`.

[source,python]
----
return None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function is used to find a target string within a list of strings. It raises an error if the list of strings or the target string is empty, and returns the index of the string that contains the target substring if found, and `None` otherwise.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code from `solution_12.py` is a linear search approach to find a target substring within a list of strings. This method has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The linear search approach is simple and easy to understand. It iterates over each string in the list and checks if the target string is a substring of the current string using the `find()` method.

2. **No Preprocessing**: This method does not require any preprocessing of the input list or target string, which can save time and space for large inputs.

3. **Early Termination**: The function returns as soon as the target string is found, which can save time if the target string is found early in the list.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Efficiency**: The linear search approach has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m is the number of strings in the list and n is the average length of the strings. This can be slow for large inputs.

2. **No Parallelism**: This method processes each string in the list sequentially, which does not take advantage of potential parallelism for multi-core processors.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: The `find()` method in Python is case sensitive, which means that the function will not find the target string if the case of the characters differs. This could be a disadvantage if case-insensitive search is required.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code in `solution_12.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the for loop that iterates over each string in the list.

1. **For Loop Iteration**: The for loop iterates over each string in the list, so its time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

2. **Substring Search (`find()` method)**: The `find()` method performs a substring search for the target string in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the string.

Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input list and target string, and a few variables for iteration and pattern matching. The space usage does not grow with the size of the input list or strings.

==== Code Review

Based on the provided Python code in `solution_12.py` and the best practices you mentioned, here's a code review:

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It's broken down into small, manageable chunks (methods), and uses descriptive variable and function names. The use of docstrings for the function enhances readability.

2. **Maintainability**: The code is easy to extend and change. The separation of concerns is clear with different sections for input validation, pattern searching, and result returning.

3. **Security**: As this code doesn't deal with any sensitive data or network operations, there are no apparent security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The use of Python's built-in `find()` method for string matching is an efficient choice. However, the `find_substring` method could be optimized by returning as soon as the pattern is found, instead of checking all strings.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The code leverages Python's built-in features and doesn't seem to reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The code handles edge cases like empty strings and empty lists. However, it could be improved by handling non-string inputs and providing more informative error messages.

8. **Scalability**: The regular expression search scales well for large inputs. However, the performance could be slow for large datasets due to the nature of regular expressions.

=== Solution 13

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_13.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `find_substring` that takes two arguments: `strings` and `target`. The `strings` argument is a list of strings, and `target` is a single string. The purpose of this function is to find the index of the first string in the `strings` list that contains the `target` string as a substring. If no such string is found, the function returns `None`.

The function begins by checking if the `strings` list is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "The list of strings cannot be empty." This is done using an `if` statement that checks the truthiness of `strings`. In Python, an empty list is considered `False` when evaluated in a boolean context.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
----

Next, the function checks if the `target` string is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "The target string cannot be empty." This is done using an `if` statement that checks the truthiness of `target`. In Python, an empty string is considered `False` when evaluated in a boolean context.

[source,python]
----
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

After these initial checks, the function uses a list comprehension combined with the `next` function to find the index of the first string in `strings` that contains `target` as a substring. The list comprehension iterates over the `strings` list along with their indices using the `enumerate` function. For each string, it uses the `find` method to check if `target` is a substring. If `target` is found, the `find` method returns the starting index of `target` in the string, otherwise, it returns `-1`.

The `next` function is used to get the first index where `target` is found. If `target` is not found in any string, `next` returns `None` because of the provided default value.

[source,python]
----
return next((i for i, string in enumerate(strings) if string.find(target) != -1), None)
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function is a Python function that finds the index of the first string in a list of strings that contains a given target string. It uses Python's built-in list and string methods to perform this task efficiently.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code is a combination of Python's built-in `enumerate` function, `find` method of strings, and list comprehension. This method is used to find the index of the first string in a list that contains a given target string as a substring.

Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses built-in Python functions and methods, which makes the code clean and readable.
2. **Efficiency**: The `find` method of strings in Python is quite efficient as it stops searching as soon as it finds the target string. Combined with `enumerate` and list comprehension, this method can quickly find the target string in a list.
3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Not Optimal for Large Inputs**: While this method is efficient for small to medium-sized lists, it may not be optimal for very large lists. This is because it checks each string in the list one by one until it finds the target string. For large lists, a more efficient string matching algorithm like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore, or a data structure like Trie, could be more suitable.
2. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the target string. If the target string occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the provided code in `solution_13.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the list comprehension that iterates over each string in the list.

1. **List Comprehension Iteration**: The list comprehension iterates over each string in the list, so its time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

2. **Substring Search (`find()` method)**: The `find()` method performs a substring search for the target string in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the string.

Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input list and target string, and a few variables for iteration and pattern matching. The space usage does not grow with the size of the input list or strings.

[source,python]
----
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

After these initial checks, the function concatenates all the strings in the `strings` list into a single string using the `join` method. Then, it uses the `find` method to find the `target` string in the concatenated string. If `target` is found, the `find` method returns the starting index of `target` in the string, otherwise, it returns `-1`.

[source,python]
----
concatenated_string = ''.join(strings)

----

If the `target` string is found in the concatenated string, the function iterates over the original `strings` list to find the index of the first string that contains `target` as a substring. This is done using a `for` loop with the `enumerate` function, which provides the index and value of each string in the list. If `target` is found in a string, the function returns the index of that string.

[source,python]
----

----

In summary, the `find_substring` function is a Python function that finds the index of the first string in a list of strings that contains a given target string. It uses Python's built-in list and string methods to perform this task efficiently.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the `find_substring` function in `solution_14.py` involves concatenating all the strings in the list into a single string and then using the `find` method to find the target string in the concatenated string. If the target string is found, it iterates over the original list of strings to find the index of the first occurrence of the target string.

Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses built-in Python functions and methods, which makes the code clean and readable.
2. **Efficiency**: The `find` method of strings in Python is quite efficient as it stops searching as soon as it finds the target string. This method can quickly find the target string in the concatenated string.
3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Memory Usage**: Concatenating all the strings in the list into a single string can consume a lot of memory, especially if the list contains a large number of long strings. This could potentially lead to memory issues in a resource-constrained environment.
2. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the target string. If the target string occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `find_substring` function in `solution_14.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by two parts: the `find` method and the `for` loop.

1. **Concatenation and `find` method**: The concatenation of all strings in the list into a single string has a time complexity of O(N*M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings. The `find` method performs a substring search for the target string in the concatenated string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(N*M), where N is the length of the concatenated string.

2. **For loop**: The `for` loop iterates over each string in the list, so its time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N*M), which is the space required to store the concatenated string. This is because the function creates a new string that is a concatenation of all the strings in the list. The space usage grows with the size of the input list and the length of the strings.

3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the target string. If the target string occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.
3. **Not Optimal for Large Inputs**: While this method is efficient for small to medium-sized lists, it may not be optimal for very large lists. This is because it checks each string in the list one by one until it finds the target string. For large lists, a more efficient string matching algorithm like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore, or a data structure like Trie, could be more suitable.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `find_substring` function in `solution_15.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the `for` loop that iterates over each string in the list. Inside the loop, it uses the `find` method of the current string to check if the `target` string is a substring of it.

The `find` method performs a substring search for the target string in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the current string.

Since this operation is performed for each string in the list, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(1), which means the space usage does not grow with the size of the input list. This is because the function does not create any new data structures that grow with the size of the input. The variables used in the function (`i`, `string`) do not take up additional space as the size of the input increases.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input strings is not a factor in the space complexity. If the size of the strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(M), where M is the length of the longest string in the list.

=== Solution 16

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_16.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The Python code in `solution_16.py` defines a function named `find_substring` that takes two arguments: `strings` and `target`. The `strings` argument is a list of strings, and `target` is a single string. The purpose of this function is to find the index of the first string in the `strings` list that contains the `target` string as a substring. If no such string is found, the function returns `None`.

The function begins by checking if the `strings` list or the `target` string is empty. If either is, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message. This is done using `if` statements that check the truthiness of `strings` and `target`. In Python, an empty list or string is considered `False` when evaluated in a boolean context.

[source,python]
----
if not strings:
    raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
if not target:
    raise ValueError("The target string cannot be empty.")
----

After these initial checks, the function uses a list comprehension to create a list of indices where the `target` string is found as a substring in the `strings` list. Inside the list comprehension, it uses the `find` method of the current string to check if the `target` string is a substring of it. If `target` is found, the `find` method returns the starting index of `target` in the string, otherwise, it returns `-1`.

[source,python]
----
indices = [i for i, string in enumerate(strings) if string.find(target) != -1]
----

Finally, the function checks if the `indices` list is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`. If it's not, the function returns the first element of the `indices` list, which is the index of the first string that contains the `target` string.

[source,python]
----
return indices[0] if indices else None
----

In summary, the `find_substring` function is a Python function that finds the index of the first string in a list of strings that contains a given target string. It uses Python's built-in list and string methods to perform this task efficiently.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the `find_substring` function in `solution_16.py` involves using a list comprehension to create a list of indices where the `target` string is found as a substring in the `strings` list. If the `target` string is found, it returns the index of the first string that contains it. If the `target` string is not found in any string, it returns `None`.

Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses built-in Python functions and methods, which makes the code clean and readable.
2. **Efficiency**: The `find` method of strings in Python is quite efficient as it stops searching as soon as it finds the target string. This method can quickly find the target string in each string in the list.
3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the target string is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.
4. **Use of List Comprehension**: The use of list comprehension makes the code more concise and easier to read.

Disadvantages:
1. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the target string. If the target string occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.
3. **Not Optimal for Large Inputs**: While this method is efficient for small to medium-sized lists, it may not be optimal for very large lists. This is because it checks each string in the list one by one until it finds the target string. For large lists, a more efficient string matching algorithm like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore, or a data structure like Trie, could be more suitable.
4. **Memory Usage**: The use of list comprehension to store all indices can lead to high memory usage when dealing with large lists.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `find_substring` function in `solution_16.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the list comprehension that iterates over each string in the list. Inside the list comprehension, it uses the `find` method of the current string to check if the `target` string is a substring of it.

The `find` method performs a substring search for the target string in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the current string.

Since this operation is performed for each string in the list, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the list and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N), which means the space usage grows linearly with the size of the input list. This is because the function creates a new list `indices` that stores the indices of all strings that contain the target string as a substring. In the worst case, all strings in the list contain the target string, so the `indices` list could be as large as the input list.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input strings is not a factor in the space complexity. If the size of the strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(M), where M is the length of the longest string in the list.

=== Solution 17

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_17.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The Python code in `solution_17.py` defines two functions: `compute_prefix_function` and `find_substring`.

The `compute_prefix_function` function is used to compute the prefix function for a given pattern. The prefix function is a concept used in the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm. It computes, for each position `i` in the pattern, the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring `pattern[0..i]` which is also a suffix of this substring.

[source,python]
----
def compute_prefix_function(pattern: str) -> list:
    prefix_function = [0] * len(pattern)
    j = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pattern)):
        while j > 0 and pattern[i] != pattern[j]:
            j = prefix_function[j - 1]
        if pattern[i] == pattern[j]:
            j += 1
        prefix_function[i] = j
    return prefix_function
----

The `find_substring` function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using the KMP algorithm. It iterates over each string in the list, and for each character in the string, it checks if it matches the next character in the pattern. If the entire pattern is found in a string, it returns the index of that string in the list. If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns `None`.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list[str], pattern: str) -> int | None:
    if not strings:
        raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
    if not pattern:
        raise ValueError("The pattern cannot be empty.")
    prefix_function = compute_prefix_function(pattern)
    for index, string in enumerate(strings):
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            while j > 0 and string[i] != pattern[j]:
                j = prefix_function[j - 1]
            if string[i] == pattern[j]:
                j += 1
            if j == len(pattern):
                return index
    return None
----

In summary, the `compute_prefix_function` function is a helper function used by the `find_substring` function to implement the KMP string matching algorithm. The `find_substring` function uses this algorithm to efficiently find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the `find_substring` function in `solution_17.py` involves using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The KMP algorithm is more efficient than the naive string matching algorithm. It avoids unnecessary comparisons by using a prefix function to skip characters that are known to match.
2. **No Extra Space**: The KMP algorithm does not require extra space proportional to the size of the text being searched. It only needs space for the pattern and the prefix function.
3. **Handles All Characters**: The method can handle any printable ASCII characters in the strings.
4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the pattern is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Complexity**: The KMP algorithm is more complex than the naive string matching algorithm. It requires understanding of the prefix function and careful implementation.
2. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the pattern. If the pattern occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.
4. **Preprocessing Overhead**: The KMP algorithm requires preprocessing of the pattern to compute the prefix function. This can add overhead, especially for large patterns. However, this cost is usually offset by the improved search efficiency.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `find_substring` function in `solution_17.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the loop that iterates over each string in the list. Inside the loop, it uses the `compute_prefix_function` function and another loop to check if the `pattern` string is a substring of the current string.

The `compute_prefix_function` function has a time complexity of O(P), where P is the length of the pattern string. This is because it iterates over each character in the pattern string once.

The inner loop in the `find_substring` function iterates over each character in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the current string.

Since these operations are performed for each string in the list, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * (P + M)), where N is the number of strings in the list, P is the length of the pattern string, and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(P), which is the space required to store the prefix function for the pattern string. This is because the function creates a new list `prefix_function` that stores the prefix function for the pattern string. The size of this list is equal to the length of the pattern string.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input strings and the list of strings are not a factor in the space complexity. If the size of the strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(M), where M is the length of the longest string in the list. If the size of the list of strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

=== Solution 18

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds occurrences of a pattern within a text. It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977. The key idea behind the algorithm is to skip comparisons by using information gathered during the preprocessing phase.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Boyer-Moore algorithm:

. *Preprocessing Phase*:
* The algorithm starts by analyzing the pattern to be searched.
* Two main tables are constructed:
** The *bad character rule table* (often called the 'delta1' table), which determines the shift amount based on the mismatched character in the pattern.
** The *good suffix rule table* (often called the 'delta2' table), which handles shifts when a suffix of the pattern matches a substring of the text.
. *Search Phase*:
* Begin matching the pattern against the text from left to right.
* Compare characters starting from the end of the pattern and moving towards the beginning.
* When a mismatch occurs:
** Use the bad character rule to shift the pattern to align with the mismatched character in the text.
** If the bad character rule suggests a shift that would move the pattern to the left of the mismatched character in the text, use the good suffix rule to determine an additional shift.
* Repeat this process until a complete match is found or the end of the text is reached.
. *Handling Mismatch*:
* When a mismatch occurs, the algorithm uses two main rules to determine the shift:
** *Bad Character Rule*: If the mismatched character in the text is present in the pattern, shift the pattern to align the rightmost occurrence of that character in the pattern with the mismatched character in the text.
** *Good Suffix Rule*: If a suffix of the pattern matches a substring to the right of the mismatch, shift the pattern to align with the last occurrence of that suffix in the pattern.
. *Performance*:
* The Boyer-Moore algorithm is efficient, especially for long patterns or patterns with a large alphabet.
* It can achieve sublinear time complexity in practice, making it one of the fastest string searching algorithms available.

By efficiently skipping comparisons using the information from the preprocessing phase, the Boyer-Moore algorithm significantly reduces the number of character comparisons needed during the search phase, making it highly efficient for practical string search applications.

==== Explanation

The Python code in `solution_18.py` defines two functions: `compute_bad_char_table` and `find_substring`.

The `compute_bad_char_table` function is used to compute the bad character table for a given pattern. The bad character table is a concept used in the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm. It computes, for each character in the pattern, the last occurrence of that character.

[source,python]

def compute_bad_char_table(pattern: str) -> dict:
    bad_char_table = {}
    for i in range(len(pattern)):

    return bad_char_table
----

The `find_substring` function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using the Boyer-Moore algorithm. It iterates over each string in the list, and for each character in the string, it checks if it matches the next character in the pattern. If the entire pattern is found in a string, it returns the index of that string in the list. If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns `None`.

[source,python]

def find_substring(strings: list[str], pattern: str) -> int | None:
    if not strings:
        raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
    if not pattern:

            else:

----

In summary, the `compute_bad_char_table` function is a helper function used by the `find_substring` function to implement the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm. The `find_substring` function uses this algorithm to efficiently find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the `find_substring` function in `solution_18.py` involves using the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The Boyer-Moore algorithm is more efficient than the naive string matching algorithm. It uses a bad character heuristic to skip sections of the text, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string algorithms in practice.
2. **No Extra Space**: The Boyer-Moore algorithm does not require extra space proportional to the size of the text being searched. It only needs space for the pattern and the bad character table.
3. **Handles All Characters**: The method can handle any printable ASCII characters in the strings.
4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the pattern is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Complexity**: The Boyer-Moore algorithm is more complex than the naive string matching algorithm. It requires understanding of the bad character heuristic and careful implementation.
2. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the pattern. If the pattern occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.
4. **Preprocessing Overhead**: The Boyer-Moore algorithm requires preprocessing of the pattern to compute the bad character table. This can add overhead, especially for large patterns. However, this cost is usually offset by the improved search efficiency.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `find_substring` function in `solution_18.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is dominated by the loop that iterates over each string in the list. Inside the loop, it uses the `compute_bad_char_table` function and another loop to check if the `pattern` string is a substring of the current string.

The `compute_bad_char_table` function has a time complexity of O(P), where P is the length of the pattern string. This is because it iterates over each character in the pattern string once.

The inner loop in the `find_substring` function iterates over each character in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the current string.

Since these operations are performed for each string in the list, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * (P + M)), where N is the number of strings in the list, P is the length of the pattern string, and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(P), which is the space required to store the bad character table for the pattern string. This is because the function creates a new dictionary `bad_char_table` that stores the bad character table for the pattern string. The size of this dictionary is equal to the length of the pattern string.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input strings and the list of strings are not a factor in the space complexity. If the size of the strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(M), where M is the length of the longest string in the list. If the size of the list of strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is easy to understand and read. It is broken down into small, manageable functions, each with a clear purpose. The variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful, which enhances readability.

2. **Maintainability**: The code is easy to maintain and extend. The separation of concerns is clear, with different functions handling different parts of the algorithm. This makes it easy to modify one part of the code without affecting the others.

3. **Security**: The code does not seem to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It does not use any insecure functions or practices. However, it's always a good idea to use static code analysis tools to detect potential security issues.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The code uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is known for its efficiency in string searching. However, the performance could be slow for large datasets due to the nature of these data structures.

=== Solution 19

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that uses hashing to efficiently find occurrences of a pattern within a text. It was developed by Michael O. Rabin and Richard M. Karp in 1987. The algorithm's main advantage lies in its ability to achieve linear average-case time complexity for string matching.

Here's a breakdown of the Rabin-Karp algorithm:

. *Hashing*:
* The algorithm begins by computing hash values for the pattern and for substrings of the text of the same length as the pattern.
* A hash function is used to convert a string (or substring) into a numerical hash value. This function should be chosen carefully to minimize the likelihood of hash collisions (two different strings having the same hash value).
. *Comparison*:
* Compare the hash value of the pattern with the hash values of substrings in the text.
* If the hash values match, perform a full character-by-character comparison to confirm the match.
* If the hash values do not match, move to the next substring in the text.
. *Sliding Window*:
* As the algorithm progresses through the text, it uses a sliding window approach to efficiently compute hash values for consecutive substrings.
* When moving from one substring to the next, instead of recomputing the hash value from scratch, the algorithm updates the hash value using a rolling hash technique. This involves subtracting the contribution of the character leaving the window and adding the contribution of the character entering the window.
. *Handling Hash Collisions*:
* Since hash collisions can occur (different substrings having the same hash value), the algorithm verifies potential matches by comparing the actual characters in those substrings.
. *Performance*:
* The Rabin-Karp algorithm typically achieves linear average-case time complexity O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
* However, in the worst-case scenario, where hash collisions are frequent, the algorithm can degrade to quadratic time complexity O((n-m+1)*m).
. *Choosing Hash Function*:
* The performance of the Rabin-Karp algorithm heavily depends on the choice of hash function. A good hash function should distribute hash values uniformly across different strings to minimize collisions.

Overall, the Rabin-Karp algorithm is particularly useful for scenarios where multiple pattern searches are performed on the same text, as it can efficiently preprocess the text and achieve linear average-case time complexity for each search. However, its performance can degrade in cases with frequent hash collisions or with patterns and texts of large sizes.

==== Explanation

The Python code in `solution_19.py` defines two functions: `compute_hash` and `find_substring`.

The `compute_hash` function calculates the hash value of a string using a specific modulus and base. This function is used in the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm. It computes the hash value of a string by summing up the ASCII value of each character in the string, multiplied by the base raised to the power of the position of the character in the string, and then taking the modulus of the result.

[source,python]
----
def compute_hash(s: str, modulus: int, base: int) -> int:
    return sum((ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + 1) * pow(base, len(s) - i - 1) for i in range(len(s))) % modulus
----

The `find_substring` function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using the Rabin-Karp algorithm. The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a text in linear time. It uses a hash function to convert the pattern and substrings of the text into integers, and then compares these integers for a match.

[source,python]
----
def find_substring(strings: list[str], pattern: str) -> int | None:
    if not strings:
        raise ValueError("The list of strings cannot be empty.")
    if not pattern:
        raise ValueError("The pattern cannot be empty.")
    modulus = 10 ** 9 + 7  # Large prime number
    base = 26  # Number of characters in the alphabet
    pattern_hash = compute_hash(pattern, modulus, base)  # Compute the hash value of the pattern
    for index, string in enumerate(strings):
        string_hash = compute_hash(string[:len(pattern)], modulus, base)
        if string_hash == pattern_hash and string[:len(pattern)] == pattern:
            return index
        for i in range(len(pattern), len(string)):
            string_hash = ((string_hash - (ord(string[i - len(pattern)]) - ord('a') + 1) * pow(base, len(pattern) - 1)) * base + (
                    ord(string[i]) - ord('a') + 1)) % modulus
            if string_hash == pattern_hash and string[i - len(pattern) + 1:i + 1] == pattern:
                return index
    return None
----

In summary, the `compute_hash` function is a helper function used by the `find_substring` function to implement the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm. The `find_substring` function uses this algorithm to efficiently find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the `find_substring` function in `solution_19.py` involves using the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings.

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The Rabin-Karp algorithm is more efficient than the naive string matching algorithm. It uses a hash function to convert the pattern and substrings of the text into integers, and then compares these integers for a match, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string algorithms in practice.
2. **No Extra Space**: The Rabin-Karp algorithm does not require extra space proportional to the size of the text being searched. It only needs space for the pattern and the hash values.
3. **Handles All Characters**: The method can handle any printable ASCII characters in the strings.
4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the pattern is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

Disadvantages:
1. **Complexity**: The Rabin-Karp algorithm is more complex than the naive string matching algorithm. It requires understanding of the hash function and careful implementation.
2. **Single Occurrence**: The method returns the index of the first string that contains the pattern. If the pattern occurs in multiple strings in the list, this method won't find the subsequent occurrences.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'abc' and 'ABC' as different strings. Depending on the use case, this might not be the desired behavior.
4. **Hash Collisions**: The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses a hash function to convert the pattern and substrings of the text into integers. However, different strings can have the same hash value, leading to false positives. This is mitigated by checking for exact string equality when a hash match is found, but it adds an extra step to the process.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the code in `solution_19.py` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the `find_substring` function is primarily determined by the loop that iterates over each string in the list. Inside this loop, it computes the hash value of the pattern and substrings of the current string.

The `compute_hash` function has a time complexity of O(P), where P is the length of the pattern string. This is because it iterates over each character in the pattern string once.

The inner loop in the `find_substring` function iterates over each character in the current string. The worst-case time complexity of this operation is O(M), where M is the length of the current string.

Since these operations are performed for each string in the list, the overall worst-case time complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(N * (P + M)), where N is the number of strings in the list, P is the length of the pattern string, and M is the average length of the strings.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the `find_substring` function is O(P), which is the space required to store the hash value for the pattern string. This is because the function computes a hash value for the pattern string which requires space equal to the length of the pattern string.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the input strings and the list of strings are not a factor in the space complexity. If the size of the strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(M), where M is the length of the longest string in the list. If the size of the list of strings is a factor, then the space complexity would be O(N), where N is the number of strings in the list.

==== Code Review

Here is a code review based on the best practices you provided:

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Functions are broken down into small, manageable chunks. Variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful, which enhances readability.

2. **Maintainability**: The code is modular and each function has a single responsibility, which makes it easy to extend and change. The use of a helper function `compute_hash` is a good practice as it separates concerns and enhances maintainability.

3. **Security**: The code does not seem to have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It does not use any insecure functions or practices. However, it's always a good idea to perform a thorough security audit for production code.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The code uses the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which is efficient for string matching. However, the performance could be further improved by avoiding the computation of the hash for each substring from scratch.

5. **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with docstrings for each function explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and exceptions. This is a good practice and enhances maintainability.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The code does not seem to reinvent the wheel. It uses built-in Python functions and features appropriately.

7. **Reliability**: The code includes error handling for edge cases where the list of strings or the pattern is empty. This makes the function robust and less prone to runtime errors.

8. **Scalability**: The code uses the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which is efficient and scales well for large inputs. However, for very large inputs, the performance could be further improved by using more advanced data structures or algorithms.

9. **Reusability**: The `compute_hash` function is a good example of reusability. It is a separate function that can be reused in other parts of the code or in other projects.

10. **Patterns**: The code adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide and uses Pythonic patterns and idioms.

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: The tests cover a variety of cases, including both normal cases and edge cases. However, the tests could be improved by adding more edge cases and negative tests.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The code provides the intended functionality of finding a substring within a list of strings. It meets the expectations of stakeholders and end-users as described in the problem statement.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The code does not handle the case where the pattern is a substring of multiple strings in the list. It only returns the index of the first string that contains the pattern.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using the Rabin-Karp algorithm to solve the problem is appropriate and efficient. The architecture of the code is modular and each function has a single responsibility, which is a good practice.

== Tests

[.lead]
When testing the solution for the problem of finding a substring within a list of strings, you can consider the following strategies:

1. **Positive Test Cases**: Test with valid inputs where the target string is a substring of one or more strings in the list.
This will help ensure that your function correctly identifies and returns the index of the first string that contains the target string as a substring.

2. **Negative Test Cases**: Test with valid inputs where the target string is not a substring of any string in the list.
This will help ensure that your function correctly returns `None` in such cases.

3. **Edge Cases**: Test with edge cases such as when the list of strings is empty, when the target string is an empty string, and when the target string is longer than all the strings in the list.
These tests can help ensure that your function handles edge cases correctly.

4. **Large Inputs**: Test with large inputs to ensure that your function can handle the maximum constraints and performs well under stress.
This could involve a list with a large number of strings, or strings with a large number of characters.

5. **Special Characters**: Since the strings can contain any printable ASCII characters, test with strings that contain special characters, numbers, and punctuation.

6. **Case Sensitivity**: As the problem requires case sensitivity, test with inputs where the case of the characters in the target string and the strings in the list differ.
This will help ensure that your function correctly handles case sensitivity.

7. **Duplicate Strings**: Test with a list that contains duplicate strings.
This will help ensure that your function correctly handles such scenarios.

8. **Performance Testing**: Measure the time and space complexity of your function to ensure it meets the performance requirements.
This is especially important for large inputs.

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure that your function works correctly under a variety of scenarios and edge cases, and performs well under stress.
