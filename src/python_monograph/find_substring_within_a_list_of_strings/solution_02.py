    A node in the Trie.

    Each TrieNode object represents a node in the Trie data structure. It has two attributes:
    - children: A dictionary that maps each character in the alphabet to the next TrieNode in the Trie that the character leads to.
    - end_of_string: A boolean value that is True if this node marks the end of a string in the Trie, and False otherwise.

    Attributes:
        children (dict): A dictionary mapping characters to TrieNode objects.
        end_of_string (bool): A flag indicating whether this node is the end of a string in the Trie.
