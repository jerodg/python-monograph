    Finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using a brute force approach.

        strings (list): The list of strings to search in.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                     If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.
