def find_substring(strings: list[str], target: str) -> int | None:
    """
    This function finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a list of strings using a brute force approach.

    Args:
        strings (list[str]): The list of strings to search in.
        target (str): The pattern to search for.

    Returns:
        int | None: The index of the first string in the list where the pattern is found as a substring.
                     If the pattern is not found in any string, it returns None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the list of strings is empty or the target string is empty.

    Doctest:
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "pyt")
        2
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "java")
        >>> find_substring(["hello", "world", "python", "programming"], "o")
