:description: Find the Equilibrium Index of an Array Problem
:keywords: problem, python

= {description}

[.lead]
The task is to find the equilibrium index of an array.
The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

Given a sequence `arr[]` of size `n`, we need to write a function `equilibrium(arr: List[int], n: int) -> int` that returns an equilibrium index (if any) or -1 if no equilibrium index exists.

The function takes two parameters:
1. `arr` (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.
2. `n` (int): The size of the array.

The function should return an integer representing the equilibrium index of the array if it exists, otherwise -1.

For example, consider the array `[-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]`.
The function should return `3` as an output because at index `3`, the sum of array elements to the left is `(-7 + 1 + 5 = -1)` and to the right is `( -4 + 3 + 0 = -1)`.

This problem requires understanding of array manipulation and mathematical summation.
The solution can be achieved by iterating over the array and calculating the sum of elements to the left and right of each index.
The index where these sums are equal is the equilibrium index.
If no such index is found, the function should return -1.

== Constraints

The constraints for the problem "Find the Equilibrium Index of an Array" are as follows:

1. The array can contain both positive and negative integers.
This means the array elements are not limited to a specific range and can be any integer value.

2. The size of the array `n` is a positive integer.
This implies that the array cannot be empty and must contain at least one element.

3. The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.
If no such index exists, the function should return -1.

4. The function should be able to handle large inputs efficiently.
This is an implied constraint based on the nature of the problem.
The function should be designed in a way that it does not result in a time-out error for large inputs.

5. The function should return an integer representing the equilibrium index of the array if it exists, otherwise -1. This is a constraint on the output of the function.

These constraints should be taken into account while implementing the solution to ensure it works correctly for all possible inputs.

== Examples

Here are five examples that cover a range of use cases for the problem of finding the equilibrium index of an array:

=== Example 0

n = 7
----

.Output
[source,python,linenums]
----
0
----

Explanation: At index 0, the sum of array elements to the left is 0 (as there are no elements to the left) and to the right is (10 - 80 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 35 = 0).

=== Example 4

.Input
[source,python,linenums]
----
arr = [0, -3, 5, -4, -2, 3, 1, 0]
n = 8
----

[source,python,linenums]
----
3
----

Explanation: At index 3, the sum of array elements to the left is (0 - 3 + 5 = 2) and to the right is (-2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 2).

== Use-Cases

The problem of finding the equilibrium index of an array has several real-world applications:

1. **Balancing Load in Distributed Systems:** In distributed systems, tasks are often distributed across multiple nodes.
The equilibrium index can be used to determine the point at which the load is evenly distributed on both sides.
This can help in optimizing the performance of the system.

2. **Financial Transactions:** In financial applications, the equilibrium index can be used to find a point in time where the total amount of money coming in equals the total amount going out.
This can be useful in budgeting and financial planning.

3. **Data Analysis and Statistics:** In data analysis, finding the equilibrium index can be useful in identifying the median or the point of balance in a data set.
This can be used in various statistical analyses.

4. **Physics and Engineering:** In physics and engineering, the concept of equilibrium is widely used.
For example, in structural engineering, the equilibrium index can represent the point where the forces acting on a structure are balanced.

5. **Computer Science and Algorithms:** The problem of finding the equilibrium index is a common question in computer science and algorithms courses.
It helps students understand the concepts of array manipulation and mathematical summation.

**Q1:** How can the concept of equilibrium index be applied in machine learning and artificial intelligence?
**Q2:** Are there any specific industries or sectors where the problem of finding the equilibrium index is particularly relevant?
**Q3:** Can the concept of equilibrium index be extended to multi-dimensional arrays or matrices?
If so, how?

== Common Mistakes

When solving the problem of finding the equilibrium index of an array, there are several common mistakes that one should avoid:

1. **Not Considering Negative Numbers:** One common mistake is not considering that the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.
This can lead to incorrect results as the sum of elements at lower and higher indexes can be equal even with negative numbers.

2. **Not Handling Non-Existent Equilibrium Index:** Another common mistake is not handling the case where there is no equilibrium index.
The function should return -1 if no equilibrium index exists.

3. **Inefficient Solution:** A brute force solution that calculates the sum of elements at lower and higher indexes for each index in the array would have a time complexity of O(n^2).
This is inefficient and can lead to a time-out error for large inputs.
A more efficient solution would be to calculate the total sum of the array first and then iterate over the array while updating the sum of elements at lower and higher indexes.

4. **Not Checking Input Validity:** It's important to check that the input is valid, i.e., the array is not empty and contains at least one element.
Failing to do so can lead to unexpected errors.

5. **Incorrect Indexing:** Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning that the first element of the array is at index 0. A common mistake is to use one-based indexing, which can lead to incorrect results or out-of-bounds errors.

**Q1:** What are some strategies to avoid these common mistakes when solving this problem?
**Q2:** How can unit tests be used to catch these common mistakes?
**Q3:** What are some other common mistakes to avoid when working with arrays in Python?
