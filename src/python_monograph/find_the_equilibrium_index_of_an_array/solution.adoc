==== Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function named `method_0` that calculates the equilibrium index of an array.
The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

The function `method_0` takes a list `arr` as an argument.
It initializes two variables `leftsum` and `rightsum` to 0 and calculates the length of the array `n`.

[source,python]
----
def method_0(arr: list) -> int:
    leftsum = 0
    rightsum = 0
    n = len(arr)
----

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the array.
For each index `i`, it resets `leftsum` and `rightsum` to 0.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(n):
    leftsum = 0
    rightsum = 0
----

Inside the loop, it calculates the sum of elements on the left of the index `i` by iterating from the start of the array to the index `i` and adds each element to `leftsum`.

[source,python]
----
for j in range(i):
    leftsum += arr[j]
----

Similarly, it calculates the sum of elements on the right of the index `i` by iterating from the index `i + 1` to the end of the array and adds each element to `rightsum`.

[source,python]
----
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    rightsum += arr[j]
----

After calculating the sums, it checks if `leftsum` is equal to `rightsum`.
If they are equal, it means that the current index `i` is an equilibrium index, and the function returns `i`.

[source,python]
----
if leftsum == rightsum:
    return i
----

If the function iterates over the entire array and doesn't find an equilibrium index, it returns -1.

[source,python]
----
return -1
----

This function uses a brute force approach to find the equilibrium index by iterating over the array and for each index, it calculates the sum of elements on the left and right.
If the sums are equal, it returns the index.
If no equilibrium index is found, it returns -1.

===== Advantages

- Simplicity: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
It doesn't require any advanced data structures or algorithms.
- No additional space: The code doesn't use any extra space, as it doesn't create any new data structures.
The space complexity is O(1).
===== Disadvantages
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the code is O(n^2) because for each element in the array, it sums up all the elements to its left and right.
This can be inefficient for large arrays.
- Multiple iterations: The code iterates over the array multiple times (once for each element), which can be inefficient.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the code is O(n^2).
This is because for each element in the array, it sums up all the elements to its left and right.
This results in a quadratic time complexity as the number of operations grows quadratically with the size of the input array.
====== Space The space complexity of the code is O(1).
This is because the code doesn't use any extra space that scales with input size.
It only uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables leftsum, rightsum, and n, regardless of the size of the input array.

==== Explanation The provided Python code defines a function named `method_1` that calculates the equilibrium index of an array in an optimized way.

The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

The function `method_1` takes a list `arr` as an argument.
It initializes two variables `total_sum` and `left_sum` to the sum of all elements in the array and 0, respectively.

[source,python]
----
total_sum = sum(arr)
left_sum = 0
----

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the array.
For each index `i` and corresponding element `num`, it subtracts `num` from `total_sum`.

[source,python]
----
for i, num in enumerate(arr):
    total_sum -= num
----

After subtracting `num` from `total_sum`, it checks if `left_sum` is equal to `total_sum`.
If they are equal, it means that the current index `i` is an equilibrium index, and the function returns `i`.

[source,python]
----
if left_sum == total_sum:
    return i
----

If `left_sum` is not equal to `total_sum`, it adds `num` to `left_sum` and continues to the next iteration.

[source,python]
----
left_sum += num
----

If the function iterates over the entire array and doesn't find an equilibrium index, it returns -1.

[source,python]
----
return -1
----

This function uses an optimized approach to find the equilibrium index by calculating the sum of elements on the left and right in a single pass.
If the sums are equal, it returns the index.
If no equilibrium index is found, it returns -1.
===== Advantages - Efficiency: The code is more efficient than the brute force approach as it calculates the sum of elements on the left and right in a single pass.
This reduces the time complexity to O(n).
- Simplicity: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
It doesn't require any advanced data structures or algorithms.
- No additional space: The code doesn't use any extra space, as it doesn't create any new data structures.
The space complexity is O(1).
===== Disadvantages - Single pass: While the single pass approach is more efficient, it may not be suitable for all scenarios.
For example, if the array is being modified concurrently by another thread, a single pass approach may lead to incorrect results.
- No error checking: The code doesn't check if the input is a valid list.
If the input is not a list or is a list with non-numeric elements, the code will throw an error.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of the code is O(n).
This is because the function iterates over the array once, and for each element, it performs a constant amount of operations (subtracting the element from total_sum, comparing left_sum and total_sum, and adding the element to left_sum).
Therefore, the number of operations grows linearly with the size of the input array.
====== Space The space complexity of the code is O(1).
This is because the code doesn't use any extra space that scales with input size.
It only uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables total_sum, left_sum, i, and num, regardless of the size of the input array.
