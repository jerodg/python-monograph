    This function generates all permutations of a given list of integers using an iterative approach.

        nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of all permutations of the input list. Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_03([1, 2, 3])
        [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
