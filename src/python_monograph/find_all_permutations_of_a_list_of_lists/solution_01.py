def backtrack(output: list[list[int]], nums: list[int], start: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    This helper function generates all permutations of the list from the given start index.

    It uses a recursive approach to generate the permutations. It iterates over the list from the start index, swaps each element
    with the start element, and then recursively generates all permutations of the remaining list.

    Args:
        output (list[list[int]]): The list to store the permutations.
        nums (list[int]): The input list of integers.
        start (int): The start index for generating permutations.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: The list of all permutations of the input list. Each permutation is represented as a list of integers.

    Examples:
        >>> backtrack([], [1, 2, 3], 0)
        [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1], [3, 1, 2]]
