    Sorts a list of strings in a way that is intuitive to humans (natural sort).
    This function sorts strings containing numbers based on the numerical value of the number, not its lexicographical order.
    This means that '10' comes after '2' when sorting a list of strings.

    Args:
        lst (list): The list of strings to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with the strings sorted in natural order.

    Doctest:
        >>> natural_sort(['file1.txt', 'file10.txt', 'file2.txt'])
        ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file10.txt']
