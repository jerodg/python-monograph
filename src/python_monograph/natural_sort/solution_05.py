def natural_sort(lst: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Sorts a list of strings in a way that is intuitive to humans using a divide and conquer approach.

    This function uses a divide and conquer approach to sort the list of strings. It first divides the list into two halves,
    then recursively sorts each half, and finally merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted list. The sorting is done
    based on the natural order of the strings, which is determined by a helper function `natural_keys`.

    Args:
        lst (List[str]): The list of strings to be sorted.

    Returns:
        List[str]: The sorted list of strings.

    Examples:
        >>> natural_sort(['file1.txt', 'file10.txt', 'file2.txt'])
        ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file10.txt']

        >>> natural_sort(['image99.png', 'image100.png', 'image101.png', 'image1.png', 'image10.png'])
        ['image1.png', 'image10.png', 'image99.png', 'image100.png', 'image101.png']

        >>> natural_sort(['version1.10', 'version1.2', 'version1.1'])
        ['version1.1', 'version1.2', 'version1.10']

        Splits a string into a list of parts, each part is either a string of non-digit characters or an integer.

        This helper function is used to determine the natural order of the strings. It splits the input string into parts
        using a regular expression. Each part that consists of digit characters is converted to an integer, and each part
        that consists of non-digit characters is left as a string. The resulting list of parts is used for comparison when
        sorting the strings.

        Args:
            s (str): The string to be split.

        Returns:
            List[Union[str, int]]: The list of parts.

        Merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

        This helper function is used to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. It compares the strings in the
        two lists based on their natural order, which is determined by the `natural_keys` function, and appends the smaller
        string to the merged list. If one list becomes empty before the other, the remaining strings in the non-empty list
        are appended to the merged list.

            left (List[str]): The left sorted list.
