== Problem

[.lead]
You need to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.

=== Use-Cases

Finding the intersection of two lists of tuples is a common task in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Data Analysis**: In data analysis, you might have two datasets (represented as lists of tuples) and you want to find common data points (intersection) between them.
This can be useful in comparative analysis, correlation studies, etc.

2. **Database Operations**: In database operations, finding the intersection of two lists of tuples can be analogous to performing a JOIN operation on two tables based on common attributes.

3. **Set Operations**: In mathematics and computer science, finding the intersection of two sets is a fundamental operation.
If the sets are represented as lists of tuples, this operation can be used in various scenarios like solving problems related to graph theory, combinatorics, etc.

4. **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, finding the intersection of two lists of tuples can be used in feature selection where you want to find common features (attributes) in different datasets.

5. **Network Analysis**: In network analysis, you might have two lists of connections (represented as tuples) and you want to find common connections (intersection) between them.

These are just a few examples.
The concept of finding the intersection of two lists of tuples can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
