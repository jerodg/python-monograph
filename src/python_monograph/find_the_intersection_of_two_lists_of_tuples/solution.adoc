=== Method 0:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_0(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> set:
    """Using sorted(), set(), and list comprehension

    :param ls0: (list)
    :param ls1: (list)
    :return: (set)"""
    return set([tuple(sorted(x)) for x in ls0]) & set([tuple(sorted(y)) for y in ls1])
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method0`.
This function takes two lists as input parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, and returns a set.
The purpose of this function is to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.

The function begins by using a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the list `ls0`.
For each element, it sorts the tuple `x` and converts it into a tuple again.
This is done using the `sorted()` function and the `tuple()` function.
The sorted tuples are then converted into a set.
This is done using the `set()` function.
The same process is repeated for the list `ls1`.

[source,python]
----
set([tuple(sorted(x)) for x in ls0])
set([tuple(sorted(y)) for y in ls1])
----

The intersection of these two sets is then found using the `&` operator.
The `&` operator in Python is used for set intersection.
It returns a set which is the intersection of two sets.

[source,python]
----
set([tuple(sorted(x)) for x in ls0]) & set([tuple(sorted(y)) for y in ls1])
----

The result of this operation, which is a set of tuples that are common to both `ls0` and `ls1`, is then returned by the function.

In summary, `method0` is a Python function that finds and returns the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It does this by converting the lists into sets of sorted tuples and then finding the intersection of these sets.

===== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The function is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions and operators, making it accessible to developers familiar with Python.

2. **Efficiency**: The function uses set operations, which are generally faster than list operations for large data sets.
This is because set operations in Python are implemented using hash tables.

3. **Uniqueness**: By converting the lists to sets, the function automatically removes duplicate tuples from the lists.
This can be an advantage if you only want unique intersections.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Order**: Sets in Python are unordered.
This means that the function does not preserve the order of the tuples from the original lists.

2. **Mutability**: The function converts the tuples in the lists to sets.
This means that the original tuples, which are mutable, are lost.
If you need to preserve the original tuples for some reason, this could be a disadvantage.

3. **Time Complexity**: The function has a time complexity of O(m * n log n + min(len(ls0), len(ls1))), where m is the length of the list and n is the length of the tuple.
This could be a disadvantage if you are working with large lists or tuples.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time Time Complexity: The time complexity of the function method_0 is dominated by the list comprehension and the set intersection operation.
The list comprehension involves sorting each tuple in the list.
The time complexity of sorting a tuple is O(n log n), where n is the length of the tuple.
Since this operation is performed for each tuple in the list, the overall time complexity for this part is O(m * n log n), where m is the length of the list.
The set intersection operation (&) has a time complexity of O(min(len(ls0), len(ls1))).
This is because in the worst case, every element in the smaller set is compared with every element in the larger set.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(m * n log n + min(len(ls0), len(ls1))).
====== Space Space Complexity: The space complexity of the function is determined by the space required to store the sets created from the lists.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the lists.
Please note that this analysis assumes that the sizes of the lists ls0 and ls1 are roughly equivalent.
If one list is significantly larger than the other, it could impact the time complexity of the set intersection operation.
==== Tests === Method 1:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_1(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> set:
    """Using list comprehension, map(), frozenset(), and &

    :param ls0: (list)
    :param ls1: (list)
    :return: (set)"""
    return set(map(frozenset, ls0)) & set(map(frozenset, ls1))
----

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_1`.

This function takes two lists as input parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, and returns a set.
The purpose of this function is to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.

The function uses the `map()` function to apply the `frozenset()` function to each element in the lists `ls0` and `ls1`.
The `frozenset()` function is used to create an immutable set from the tuples.
This is necessary because sets in Python cannot contain mutable elements, and tuples are mutable.
By converting the tuples to frozensets, they can be included in a set.

[source,python]
----
set(map(frozenset, ls0))
set(map(frozenset, ls1))
----

The intersection of these two sets is then found using the `&` operator.
The `&` operator in Python is used for set intersection.
It returns a set which is the intersection of two sets.

[source,python]
----
set(map(frozenset, ls0)) & set(map(frozenset, ls1))
----

The result of this operation, which is a set of frozensets that are common to both `ls0` and `ls1`, is then returned by the function.

In summary, `method_1` is a Python function that finds and returns the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It does this by converting the tuples into frozensets, converting the lists into sets of frozensets, and then finding the intersection of these sets.
===== Advantages 1. **Efficiency**: The function uses the set intersection operation (`&`), which is generally efficient and faster than manual iteration.
2. **Simplicity**: The function is relatively simple and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions and operators, making it easy to read and maintain.
3. **Immutable Elements**: By converting the tuples to frozensets, the function ensures that the elements in the sets are immutable.
This is necessary because sets in Python cannot contain mutable elements.
===== Disadvantages 1. **Mutability**: The function converts the tuples in the lists to frozensets.
This means that the original tuples, which are mutable, are lost.
If you need to preserve the original tuples for some reason, this could be a disadvantage.
2. **Time Complexity**: The function has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m is the length of the list and n is the length of the tuple.
This could be a disadvantage if you are working with large lists or tuples.

Please note that the time complexity mentioned above is a rough estimate and the actual time complexity may vary depending on the specific data and Python's internal optimizations.
===== Complexity Analysis
NOTE: Please note that this analysis assumes that the sizes of the lists ls0 and ls1 are roughly equivalent.
If one list is significantly larger than the other, it could impact the time complexity of the set intersection operation.

====== Time

The time complexity of method_1 is dominated by the map() function and the set intersection operation (&).
The map() function applies the frozenset() function to each tuple in the list, which takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the tuple.
Since this operation is performed for each tuple in the list, the overall time complexity for this part is O(m * n), where m is the length of the list.
The set intersection operation (&) has a time complexity of O(min(len(ls0), len(ls1))).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(m * n + min(len(ls0), len(ls1))).
====== Space The space complexity of method_1 is determined by the space required to store the sets created from the lists.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the lists.
==== Tests === Method 2:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_2(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> list:
    """Using list comprehension

    :param ls0: (list)
    :param ls1: (list)
    :return: (list)"""
    return [x for x in ls0 for y in ls1 if x == y]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_2`.
This function is designed to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
The intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are common to both sets.
In this case, the function is finding all tuples that appear in both lists.

The function takes two parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, which are expected to be lists of tuples.
The function returns a list of tuples that are found in both input lists.

The core of this function is a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.
The list comprehension iterates over each tuple `x` in the first list `ls0` and for each tuple `y` in the second list `ls1`.
If `x` is equal to `y`, it adds `x` to the result list.
Here's the core part of the function:

[source,python]
----
[x for x in ls0 for y in ls1 if x == y]
----

This line of code is equivalent to the following nested for loop:

[source,python]
----
result = []
for x in ls0:
    for y in ls1:
        if x == y:
            result.append(x)
----

However, the list comprehension is more concise and typically more efficient.

In summary, `method_2` is a Python function that uses list comprehension to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It iterates over each tuple in the first list and checks if it exists in the second list.
If it does, it adds the tuple to the result.

===== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The function is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.
2. **Preservation of Order**: Unlike methods that convert the lists to sets, this method preserves the order of the tuples from the original lists.
3. **Preservation of Duplicates**: This method also preserves duplicate tuples.
If a tuple appears multiple times in both lists, it will appear multiple times in the result.
===== Disadvantages
1. **Efficiency**: This method uses nested loops to find the intersection, which can be inefficient for large lists.
The time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the lists.
This could be a disadvantage if you are working with large lists.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list for the result, which can consume a significant amount of memory if the lists are large.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of method_2 is dominated by the list comprehension, which involves nested loops.
For each tuple x in the first list ls0, it iterates over each tuple y in the second list ls1. Therefore, if there are m tuples in ls0 and n tuples in ls1, the time complexity is O(m * n).
====== Space The space complexity of method_2 is determined by the space required to store the result list.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique and all tuples in ls0 are in ls1, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the list ls0 ==== Tests === Method 3:
==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]

def method_3(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> list:
    """Using set.intersection()

    :param ls0: (list)
    :param ls1: (list)
    :return: (list)"""
    return list(set(ls0).intersection(set(ls1)))
----

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_3`.

This function is designed to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
The intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are common to both sets.
In this case, the function is finding all tuples that appear in both lists.

The function takes two parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, which are expected to be lists of tuples.
The function returns a list of tuples that are found in both input lists.

The core of this function is the use of Python's built-in `set` and `intersection` functions.
It converts the input lists into sets and then uses the `intersection` function to find the common elements.
Here's the core part of the function:

[source,python]
----
set(ls0).intersection(set(ls1))
----

This line of code is equivalent to using the `&` operator between two sets:

[source,python]
----
set(ls0) & set(ls1)
----

However, the `intersection` function is more explicit and may be easier to understand for some developers.

The result of the intersection operation is a set, which is then converted back into a list before being returned by the function.

In summary, `method_3` is a Python function that uses the `set` and `intersection` functions to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It converts the lists into sets, finds the common elements, and then converts the result back into a list.
===== Advantages 1. **Efficiency**: The function uses set operations, which are generally faster than list operations for large data sets.
This is because set operations in Python are implemented using hash tables.
2. **Simplicity**: The function is relatively simple and easy to understand.

2. **Mutability**: The function converts the tuples in the lists to sets.
This means that the original tuples, which are mutable, are lost.
If you need to preserve the original tuples for some reason, this could be a disadvantage.
3. **Time Complexity**: The function has a time complexity of O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the lists.
This could be a disadvantage if you are working with large lists.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of method_3 is dominated by the set conversion and intersection operations.
Converting a list to a set in Python takes O(m) time, where m is the length of the list.
This operation is performed twice, once for each list, so the total time for this part is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the lists ls0 and ls1 respectively.
The set intersection operation has a time complexity of O(min(m, n)).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(m + n).
====== Space The space complexity of method_3 is determined by the space required to store the sets created from the lists and the result list.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique, the space complexity would be O(m + n), where m and n are the total number of tuples in the lists ls0 and ls1 respectively.

def method_4(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> list:
    """Using a List Comprehension with in Operator

    :param ls0: (list)

    return [x for x in ls0 if x in ls1]
----

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_4`.

This function is designed to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
The intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are common to both sets.
In this case, the function is finding all tuples that appear in both lists.

The function takes two parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, which are expected to be lists of tuples.
The function returns a list of tuples that are found in both input lists.

The core of this function is the use of Python's list comprehension and the `in` operator.
It iterates over each tuple in the first list and checks if it exists in the second list.
If it does, it adds the tuple to the result.
Here's the core part of the function:

[source,python]
----
[x for x in ls0 if x in ls1]
----

This line of code is equivalent to using a for loop to iterate over the first list and an if statement to check if each tuple exists in the second list.
However, using a list comprehension is more concise and often more efficient.

In summary, `method_4` is a Python function that uses a list comprehension and the `in` operator to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It iterates over the tuples in the first list and checks if they exist in the second list, adding the common tuples to the result.

NOTE: This method does not preserve the order of the tuples from the original lists and do not handle duplicate tuples.
If you need to preserve the order or handle duplicates, you may need to modify these methods or use a different approach.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity**: The function is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.
2. **Preservation of Order**: Unlike methods that convert the lists to sets, this method preserves the order of the tuples from the original lists.
3. **Preservation of Duplicates**: This method also preserves duplicate tuples.
If a tuple appears multiple times in both lists, it will appear multiple times in the result.
===== Disadvantages 1. **Efficiency**: This method uses the `in` operator to check if a tuple from the first list exists in the second list.
This operation can be inefficient for large lists because it needs to scan through the entire second list for each tuple in the first list.
The time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the lists.
This could be a disadvantage if you are working with large lists.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list for the result, which can consume a significant amount of memory if the lists are large.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of method_4 is dominated by the list comprehension, which involves the in operator.
For each tuple x in the first list ls0, it checks if x is in the second list ls1. Therefore, if there are m tuples in ls0 and n tuples in ls1, the time complexity is O(m * n).
====== Space The space complexity of method_4 is determined by the space required to store the result list.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique and all tuples in ls0 are in ls1, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the list ls0 ==== Tests === Method 5:
==== Implementation

def method_5(ls0: list, ls1: list) -> list:
    """Using the filter() Function

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_5`.

This function is designed to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
The intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are common to both sets.
In this case, the function is finding all tuples that appear in both lists.

The function takes two parameters, `ls0` and `ls1`, which are expected to be lists of tuples.
The function returns a list of tuples that are found in both input lists.

The core of this function is the use of Python's `filter()` function and the `in` operator.
It uses a lambda function to check if each tuple from the first list exists in the second list and filters out the tuples that do not.
Here's the core part of the function:

[source,python]
----
filter(lambda x: x in ls1, ls0)
----

This line of code is equivalent to using a for loop to iterate over the first list and an if statement to check if each tuple exists in the second list.
However, using the `filter()` function is more concise.

The `filter()` function returns a filter object, which is an iterator that yields the tuples that pass the filter.
This filter object is then converted to a list using the `list()` function.

In summary, `method_5` is a Python function that uses the `filter()` function and the `in` operator to find the intersection of two lists of tuples.
It iterates over the tuples in the first list and checks if they exist in the second list, adding the common tuples to the result.
===== Advantages 1. **Simplicity**: The function is straightforward and easy to understand.

====== Space The space complexity of method_5 is determined by the space required to store the result list.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique and all tuples in ls0 are in ls1, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the list ls0.

The function returns a list of tuples that are found in both input lists.

The core of this function is the use of Python's set comprehension and the `intersection()` method.
It creates a set from the first list `ls0` and then uses the `intersection()` method to find common tuples in the second list `ls1`.
Here's the core part of the function:

This operation is performed once for the list ls0. The intersection() method has a time complexity of O(min(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the lists ls0 and ls1 respectively.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(m + min(m, n)).
====== Space The space complexity of method_6 is determined by the space required to store the set created from the list ls0 and the result list.
In the worst case, if all tuples in the lists are unique, the space complexity would be O(m), where m is the total number of tuples in the list ls0.
