    Determines if two circles intersect using an analytical geometry approach.

    This function calculates the Euclidean distance between the centers of the two circles.
    If the distance is less than or equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles, then the circles intersect.

    Args:
        circle1 (Circle): The first circle, represented as an instance of the Circle class.
        circle2 (Circle): The second circle, represented as an instance of the Circle class.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the circles intersect, False otherwise.

    Doctests:
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
        True
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(4, 0, 3)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
        True
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(10, 0, 3)
