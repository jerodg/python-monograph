    Determines if two circles intersect using a Monte Carlo approach.

    Args:
        circle1 (Circle): The first circle, represented as a tuple of (x, y, r).
        circle2 (Circle): The second circle, represented as a tuple of (x, y, r).
        num_samples (int, optional): The number of random points to sample. Defaults to 10000.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the circles intersect, False otherwise.
