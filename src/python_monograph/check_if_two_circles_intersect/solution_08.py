def do_circles_intersect(circle1: CircleBB, circle2: CircleBB) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if two circles intersect.

    This function checks if two circles intersect by first checking if their bounding boxes intersect.
    If the bounding boxes do not intersect, the circles do not intersect.
    If the bounding boxes do intersect, the function calculates the distance between the centers of the circles.
    The circles intersect if the distance is less than or equal to the sum of their radii.

    Args:
        circle1 (CircleBB): The first circle.
        circle2 (CircleBB): The second circle.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the circles intersect, False otherwise.

    Doctests:
        >>> c1 = CircleBB(0, 0, 5)
        >>> c2 = CircleBB(0, 0, 5)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(c1, c2)
        True
        >>> c1 = CircleBB(0, 0, 5)
        >>> c2 = CircleBB(10, 0, 3)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(c1, c2)
        False
        >>> c1 = CircleBB(0, 0, 5)
        >>> c2 = CircleBB(4, 0, 3)
