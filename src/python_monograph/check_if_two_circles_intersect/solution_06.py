def do_circles_intersect(circle1: Circle, circle2: Circle) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if two circles intersect using a graphical approach and matplotlib.

    This function creates a plot with two circles based on the input parameters.
    It then checks if any point on the perimeter of the first circle lies within the second circle.
    If such a point is found, the function returns True, indicating that the circles intersect.
    The function also displays the plot of the circles.

    Args:
        circle1 (Circle): The first circle, represented by a Circle object.
        circle2 (Circle): The second circle, represented by a Circle object.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the circles intersect, False otherwise.

    Doctests:
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
        True
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(4, 0, 3)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
        True
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(10, 0, 3)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
        False
        >>> circle1 = Circle(0, 0, 5)
        >>> circle2 = Circle(4, 4, 5)
        >>> do_circles_intersect(circle1, circle2)
