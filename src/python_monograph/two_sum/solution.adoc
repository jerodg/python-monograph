=== Method 0: Brute Force

The brute force approach is an inelegant approach that gets the job done.
Loop through each element i and find if there is another value that equals to target−i.

        for j, m in enumerate(nums[i + 1:]):
            if n + m == target:
                return [i, j + i + 1]

==== Explanation

==== Complexity Analysis

===== Time

The time complexity of method_0 is O(n^2^).
This is because there are two nested loops in the function.
The outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the input list nums.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs n - i times, where i is the current index of the outer loop.
Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the total number of iterations is proportional to n^2^, hence the time complexity is O(n^2^).
===== Space The space complexity of method_0 is O(1).
This is because the space required by the function does not increase with the size of the input list nums.
The function only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables i, j, nums, and target, regardless of the length of nums.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), which means constant space complexity.
=== Method 1: Two-pass Hash Table To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array.
If the complement exists, we need to get its index.
What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index?
A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed.
A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time.
I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n) time.
However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

A simple implementation uses two iterations.
In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table.
Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (target−nums[i]) exists in the hash table.
If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index.
Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!

==== Explanation

The provided code is a Python function named `method_1` that solves the Two Sum problem.
The Two Sum problem is a common coding problem where given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, you need to find two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

The function `method_1` takes two arguments: `nums`, a list of integers, and `target`, an integer.
It returns a list of two integers that are the indices of the two numbers in `nums` that add up to `target`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_1(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
----

The function uses a dictionary `d` to store the elements of `nums` as it iterates over them.
The dictionary `d` is used to map each number to its index in the list.
This is done in the first loop.

[source,python,linenums]
----
d = {}
for i, n in enumerate(nums):
    d[n] = i
----

In the second loop, the function checks if the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - n`) exists in the dictionary `d` and that it's not the same element.
If it does, it means we have found two numbers that add up to `target`, and we return their indices.

[source,python]
----
for i, n in enumerate(nums):
    if target - n in d and i != d[target - n]:
        return [i, d[target - n]]
----

This approach is known as the two-pass hash table approach because it requires two passes over the input list `nums`.
It is an efficient solution to the Two Sum problem with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`.
==== Complexity Analysis ===== Time The time complexity of method_1 is O(n).
This is because there are two separate loops that iterate over the list nums.
Each loop runs n times, where n is the length of the input list nums.
However, these loops are not nested, so the total number of iterations is 2n, which simplifies to O(n) in Big O notation.
===== Space The space complexity of method_1 is O(n).
This is because a dictionary d is used to store the elements of the list nums.
In the worst-case scenario, every element from nums is stored in the dictionary, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
=== Method 2: One-pass Hash Table It turns out we can do it in one-pass.
While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if the current element's complement already exists in the hash table.
If it exists, we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.

    if target - n in d:
        return [d[target - n], i]
    d[n] = i
----

This approach is known as the one-pass hash table approach because it only requires a single pass over the input list `nums`.
It is an efficient solution to the Two Sum problem with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`.
==== Complexity Analysis ===== Time The time complexity of method_2 is O(n).
This is because there is a single loop that iterates over the list nums.
The loop runs n times, where n is the length of the input list nums.
In each iteration, it performs a constant time operation of checking if target - n is in the dictionary d and adding an element to the dictionary.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
===== Space The space complexity of method_2 is also O(n).
This is because a dictionary d is used to store the elements of the list nums.
In the worst-case scenario, every element from nums is stored in the dictionary, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
== Additional Learning Hash tables are a powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of common coding problems.
Here are a few examples:

Counting Frequencies:

- Hash tables can be used to count the frequency of elements in a list.
This is useful in problems where you need to find the most common element, or elements that appear more than a certain number of times.

Subarray Sum Equals K:

- Given an array of integers and an integer K, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to K. This can be solved using a hash table to store the cumulative sum of elements and their counts.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:

- Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
This can be solved using a hash table to store the last index of each character encountered.

Group Anagrams:

- Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
This can be solved using a hash table to categorize strings by their sorted character sequences.

First Unique Character in a String:

- Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
This can be solved using a hash table to count the occurrences of each character.

Intersection of Two Arrays:

- Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
This can be solved using a hash table to store the elements of one array, and then check the elements of the other array against it.
