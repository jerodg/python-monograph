    """Method 0: Brute Force (iteration)

    This function takes a list of integers and a target integer as input.
    It iterates over the list of integers twice (nested iteration) to find two numbers that add up to the target.
    The function returns a list containing the indices of the two numbers in the original list.
    If no such pair of numbers is found, the function returns None.

    Args:
        nums: A list of integers.
        target: An integer that we want to find two numbers in the list that add up to.

    Returns:
        A list of two integers representing the indices in the original list of the two numbers that add up to the target.
        If no such pair of numbers is found, the function returns None.

    """Method 1: Two-pass Hash Table

    This function takes a list of integers and a target integer as input.
    It uses a hash table (dictionary in Python) to store the integers from the list as keys and their indices as values.
    The function then iterates over the list of integers again, checking if the difference between the target and the current
    integer is in the hash table.
    If it is, and the index of the current integer is not the same as the index stored in the hash table for the difference,
    the function returns a list containing the indices of the two numbers.
