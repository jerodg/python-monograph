def solution_02(arr: List[int], req_sum: int) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    This function returns the number of pairs in the input list `arr` that sum up to `req_sum` using a two-pointer approach,
    and a list of the pairs.

    The function uses a two-pointer approach. It first sorts the array, then initializes two pointers, one at the start
    of the array and one at the end. It then iterates over the array, and for each iteration, it calculates the sum of
    the elements at the two pointer positions. If the sum is equal to the target sum, it increments the count, adds the pair to
    the list, and moves
    both pointers towards the center of the array. If the sum is less than the target sum, it moves the start pointer
    towards the end of the array. If the sum is greater than the target sum, it moves the end pointer towards the start
    of the array.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.
        req_sum (int): The required sum.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: The number of pairs in `arr` that sum up to `req_sum`, and a list of the pairs.

    Doctests:
    >>> solution_02([1, 5, 7, 1], 6)
    (2, [(1, 5), (5, 1)])
    >>> solution_02([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
