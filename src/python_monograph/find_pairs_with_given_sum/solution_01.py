def solution_01(arr: List[int], req_sum: int) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    This function returns the number of pairs in the input list `arr` that sum up to `req_sum` using a hash map, and a list of
    the pairs.

    The function uses a hash map to store the frequency of each number in the array. Then, for each number in the array,
    it subtracts the target sum from it and checks if the result is in the hash map. If it is, it adds the frequency of
    that number to the count.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.
        req_sum (int): The required sum.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: The number of pairs in `arr` that sum up to `req_sum`, and a list of the pairs.

    Doctests:
    >>> solution_01([1, 5, 7, 1], 6)
    (2, [(1, 5), (5, 1)])
    >>> solution_01([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
