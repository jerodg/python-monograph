    """
    This function returns the number of pairs in the input list `arr` that sum up to `req_sum` using the `combinations`
    function from the `itertools` module, and a list of the pairs.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.
        req_sum (int): The required sum.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]: The number of pairs in `arr` that sum up to `req_sum`, and a list of the pairs.

    Doctests:
    >>> solution_00([1, 5, 7, 1], 6)
    (2, [(1, 5), (5, 1)])
    >>> solution_00([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
    (28, [(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1),
    (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)])
    >>> solution_00([1, 7, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 9, 8], 7)
    (4, [(1, 6), (6, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2)])

    The function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible pairs of numbers in `arr`.
    It then uses a list comprehension to create a list of pairs that sum up to `req_sum`. The length of this list and the list
    itself are returned.

    # Generate all possible pairs of numbers in `arr` that sum up to `req_sum`
    pairs = [(a, b) for a, b in combinations(arr, 2) if a + b == req_sum]
    # Return the count of pairs and the pairs themselves
    return len(pairs), pairs
