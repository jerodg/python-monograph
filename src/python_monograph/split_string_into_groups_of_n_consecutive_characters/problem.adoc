:description: Split Strings into Groups of n Consecutive Characters Problem
:keywords: problem, python, algorithm, split, string, group, n, consecutive, characters

= {description}

[.lead]
In this problem, we are given a string and a number `n`.
The task is to write a Python program that splits the given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

'''

The input to the problem is a string and a positive integer `n`.
The string can be of any length and can contain any printable ASCII characters.
The integer `n` represents the size of the groups in which the string should be split.

The output of the problem should be a list of strings, where each string in the list is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.
The groups should be formed from left to right.
If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld" and `n` is 3, the output should be ["Hel", "loW", "orl", "d"].
If the input string is "Python" and `n` is 2, the output should be ["Py", "th", "on"].

The goal of the problem is to implement a function `split_string_into_groups(string: str, n: int) -> List[str]` that takes a string and an integer as input and returns a list of strings as output.

The function should be efficient and should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with less than `n` characters.
The function should also handle large inputs efficiently.

The problem does not require any specific knowledge of algorithms or data structures and can be solved using basic string manipulation techniques in Python.
However, different approaches may have different time and space complexities, and the choice of approach may depend on the specific requirements of the problem.

== Constraints

The constraints for the problem "Split Strings into Groups of n Consecutive Characters" could be as follows:

1. The input string can be of any length, from empty to very large strings.
2. The string can contain any printable ASCII characters.
3. The integer `n` is a positive integer and represents the size of the groups in which the string should be split.
4. If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.
5. The function should handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with less than `n` characters.
6. The function should be able to handle large inputs efficiently, implying a need for a time complexity that is linear or better.
7. The function should return a list of strings, where each string in the list is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.

== Use-Cases

The solutions to the problem of splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters can have several real-world applications:

1. **Text Processing and Analysis**: This problem is common in natural language processing and computational linguistics where text data needs to be split into chunks for further analysis.
For example, splitting a document into sentences or words for tokenization.

2. **Data Transformation**: In data preprocessing, it might be necessary to split strings into smaller parts for further processing or analysis.
For example, splitting a DNA sequence into codons for genetic analysis.

3. **Network Protocols**: In network communication, messages are often split into packets of a certain size before they are transmitted over a network.
The receiver then reassembles the packets to retrieve the original message.

4. **Cryptography**: In cryptography, plaintext is often split into blocks of a certain size before it is encrypted.
The encrypted blocks are then transmitted, and the receiver decrypts the blocks and reassembles them to retrieve the original plaintext.

5. **Data Compression**: In data compression algorithms, data is often split into chunks of a certain size.
These chunks are then compressed individually, which can result in more efficient compression than compressing the entire data as a whole.

6. **File Systems**: In file systems, files are often split into blocks of a certain size for storage.
This makes it easier to manage and retrieve files from the file system.

7. **Parallel Computing**: In parallel computing, data is often split into chunks that can be processed independently.
This allows the workload to be distributed across multiple processors, improving performance and efficiency.

== Common Mistakes

When solving the problem of splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, here are some common mistakes to avoid:

1. **Ignoring Edge Cases**: Not handling edge cases such as an empty string or a string with less than `n` characters can lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
Always ensure your solution handles these cases correctly.

2. **Not Considering String Length**: If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.
Your solution should account for this scenario.

3. **Inefficient Slicing**: Python's string slicing is efficient, but if used incorrectly, it can lead to performance issues.
For example, repeatedly slicing large strings in a loop can be inefficient.

4. **Ignoring Large Inputs**: If the function does not handle large inputs efficiently, it may result in performance issues or even exceed the maximum recursion depth for recursive solutions.
Always consider the time and space complexity of your solution.

5. **Not Preserving Order**: The problem statement specifies that the groups should be formed from left to right.
Not preserving the original order of characters in the string can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Incorrect Group Size**: The groups should contain `n` characters, but a common mistake is to off-by-one errors where groups contain `n-1` or `n+1` characters.
Always ensure your solution correctly calculates the group size.

7. **Not Returning Correct Data Type**: The function should return a list of strings.
Returning a different data type can lead to unexpected results or errors in the code that uses the function.

== Best Practices

When solving the problem of splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Make sure you fully understand the problem before you start coding.
This includes understanding the input, output, and any constraints.

2. **Plan Your Solution**: Before you start coding, plan your solution.
This could involve writing pseudocode or drawing a flowchart.
A good plan will help you write clean and efficient code.

3. **Choose the Right Data Structures**: The choice of data structures can significantly impact the performance of your solution.
For this problem, using a list to store the groups of characters is a good choice.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Make sure your solution handles edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with less than `n` characters.

5. **Use Built-in Functions**: Python has many built-in functions that can help you solve this problem.
For example, you can use the slicing feature of strings to split the string into groups of `n` characters.

6. **Write Clean Code**: Write your code in a clean and organized manner.
Use meaningful variable names, keep your functions small and focused, and include comments to explain what your code is doing.

7. **Test Your Code**: After you have written your solution, test it with a variety of test cases to make sure it works as expected.
This should include both normal cases and edge cases.

8. **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution to ensure it meets the performance requirements.
For this problem, a solution with a time complexity of O(n) would be ideal.

9. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: Always be open to learning new ways to solve problems and improve your code.
This could involve learning new algorithms, data structures, or coding techniques.

== Follow-up

After solving the problem of splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, here are some follow-up actions you could consider:

This can help you identify any potential performance bottlenecks.

3. **Refactoring**: Look for opportunities to refactor your code to make it cleaner, more efficient, or more readable.
This could involve using different data structures, algorithms, or Python built-in functions.

4. **Expand Functionality**: Consider expanding the functionality of your solution.
For example, you could modify the function to handle different types of input, such as lists or arrays of characters, instead of just strings.

5. **Error Handling**: Improve the error handling in your solution.
For example, you could add checks to ensure the input is valid and throw meaningful error messages if it's not.

6. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly, including the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and any edge cases or assumptions it makes.
Good documentation makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
