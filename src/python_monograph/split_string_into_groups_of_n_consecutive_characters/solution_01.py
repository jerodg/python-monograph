def split_string_into_groups(string: str, n: int) -> list:
    """
    Splits a given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

    This function uses Python's `re` (regex) module to solve the problem.
    It uses the `re.findall()` function with a regular expression that matches any `n` characters
    to split the string into groups of `n` characters.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string to be split.
        n (int): The size of the groups in which the string should be split.

    Returns:
        list: A list of strings, where each string in the list is a group of `n` consecutive characters
        from the input string. The groups are formed from left to right. If the length of the string
        is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the group size `n` is not a positive integer.

    Examples:
        >>> split_string_into_groups("HelloWorld", 3)
        ['Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd']

        >>> split_string_into_groups("Python", 2)
        ['Py', 'th', 'on']

        >>> split_string_into_groups("abcdef", 0)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: The group size must be a positive integer
    """
    # Check if the group size is a positive integer
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")

    # Use regex to split the string into groups of `n` characters
    return re.findall('.{1,' + str(n) + '}', string)
