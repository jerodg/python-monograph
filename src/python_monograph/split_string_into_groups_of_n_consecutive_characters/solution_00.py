def split_string_into_groups(string: str, n: int) -> list:
    """
    Splits a given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

    This function uses Python's slicing feature and list comprehension to split the string.
    It iterates over the string with a step size of `n` and slices the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.
    Each sliced string is then added to a set to remove duplicates. Finally, the set is converted back to a list and returned.

    Note: This function does not preserve the original order of the groups. If the order is important, consider a different approach.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string to be split.
        n (int): The size of the groups in which the string should be split.

    Returns:
        list: A list of unique strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the group size `n` is not a positive integer.

    Examples:
        >>> split_string_into_groups("HelloWorld", 3)
        ['loW', 'orl', 'd', 'Hel']

        >>> split_string_into_groups("Python", 2)
        ['th', 'on', 'Py']
