def split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]:
    """
    Splits a given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

    This function uses the pandas library to convert the string into a pandas Series,
    then uses the groupby method to group the characters into groups of `n` characters.
    The groups are then converted back to a list of strings.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be split.
        n (int): The size of the groups.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `n` is not a positive integer.

    Examples:
        >>> split_string_into_groups("HelloWorld", 3)
        ['Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("Python", 2)
        ['Py', 'th', 'on']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("1234567890", 4)
        ['1234', '5678', '90']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("abc", 1)
        ['a', 'b', 'c']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("abc", 5)
        ['abc']
