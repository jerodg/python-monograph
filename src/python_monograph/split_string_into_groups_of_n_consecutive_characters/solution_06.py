    """
    Splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters using numpy.reshape().

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be split.
        n (int): The size of the groups.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `n` is not a positive integer.

    Examples:
        >>> split_string_into_groups("HelloWorld", 3)
        ['Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("Python", 2)
        ['Py', 'th', 'on']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("1234567890", 4)
        ['1234', '5678', '90']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("abc", 1)
        ['a', 'b', 'c']
        >>> split_string_into_groups("abc", 5)
        ['abc']
