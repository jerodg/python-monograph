= {description}

== Approaches

1. **Using List Comprehension and Slicing**: This is a simple and straightforward approach where we can use Python's slicing feature to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
We can use list comprehension to iterate over the string with a step size of `n` and slice the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.

2. **Using the `re` (regex) Module**: Python's `re` module provides a function called `findall()`, which can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
We can use this function with a regular expression that matches any `n` characters to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

3. **Using the `textwrap` Module**: The `textwrap` module in Python provides a function called `wrap()`, which can be used to split a string into a list of output lines of specified width.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

4. **Using a Loop and String Concatenation**: We can also solve this problem by manually looping over the string and concatenating `n` characters at a time to a new string.
Once we have `n` characters, we can add the new string to a list and reset the new string to an empty string.

5. **Using Generator Function**: We can create a generator function that takes a string and a number `n` as input and yields chunks of `n` characters from the string.
This approach is memory efficient as it doesn't require storing all chunks in memory at once.

6. **Using `itertools`**: The `itertools` module in Python provides a function called `islice()`, which can be used to slice an iterable.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

7. **Using `numpy`**: We can also use the `numpy` library to solve this problem.
We can convert the string to a `numpy` array and then use the `reshape()` function to split the array into chunks of `n` characters.

8. **Using `pandas`**: The `pandas` library in Python provides a function called `groupby()`, which can be used to split an array into bins.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

9. **Using `more_itertools`**: The `more_itertools` library provides a function called `chunked()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

10. **Using `toolz`**: The `toolz` library provides a function called `partition_all()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

11. **Using `cytoolz`**: The `cytoolz` library provides a function called `partition_all()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

12. **Using `itertools`**: The `itertools` library provides a function called `zip_longest`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

13. **Using `list` + `map` + `join` + `zip`**: We can also solve this problem using the `list` function, the `map` function, the `join` method, and the `zip` function.
We can use the `map` function to iterate over the string with a step size of `n` and slice the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.
We can then use the `zip` function to combine the chunks into a list of tuples, and the `join` method to join the tuples into a list of strings.

14. **Using Recursion with Slicing**: We can also solve this problem using recursion and slicing.
We can define a recursive function that takes a string and a number `n` as input and returns a list of chunks of `n` characters.
The function can slice the string into chunks of `n` characters and call itself recursively with the remaining string until the string is empty.

15. **Using `pandas`**: The `pandas` library in Python provides a function called `cut()`, which can be used to split an array into bins.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

== Performance Optimizations

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations**: If the function performs any unnecessary operations, such as creating temporary lists or strings, these should be eliminated to improve performance.

2. **Use Built-in Functions and Libraries**: Python's built-in functions and libraries are usually optimized for performance.
If there are built-in functions or libraries that can be used to solve the problem, they should be used instead of custom code.

3. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: The choice of data structures can significantly impact the performance of a function.
For example, if the function needs to check if an element is in a collection, a set should be used instead of a list because checking membership is faster in a set.

4. **Use Lazy Evaluation**: If the function generates a large number of results, it may be more efficient to use a generator that yields the results one at a time instead of a function that returns a list of all results.

5. **Use Caching/Memoization**: If the function performs expensive computations that are repeated with the same inputs, these computations should be cached to avoid unnecessary work.

6. **Avoid Recursion**: Recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative functions due to the overhead of function calls.
If the function is recursive, it may be more efficient to rewrite it as an iterative function.

7. **Use Vectorized Operations**: If the function performs operations on arrays or matrices, it may be more efficient to use vectorized operations provided by libraries like NumPy.

8. **Parallelize Computations**: If the function performs independent computations that can be executed in parallel, these computations should be parallelized to take advantage of multiple cores or processors.

9. **Profile and Optimize Hotspots**: Use a profiler to identify the parts of the function that consume the most time (hotspots) and focus optimization efforts on these parts.

10. **Use Just-In-Time Compilation**: If the function is computationally intensive and called many times, using a just-in-time compiler like Numba can significantly improve performance.

== Solutions

=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The Python function `split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]` is designed to split a given string `s` into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
The function takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`.
The string `s` is the input string that needs to be split, and `n` is the size of the groups.

The function begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is not a positive integer, the function raises a `ValueError`.
This is done to ensure that the group size is valid.
Here is the code snippet that performs this check:

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

After validating the input, the function uses list comprehension and Python's string slicing feature to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
The list comprehension iterates over the string from the start to the end with a step size of `n`.
For each iteration, it slices the string from the current index to the current index plus `n` and adds the resulting substring to the list.
Here is the code snippet that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
return [s[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(s), n)]
----

The result is a list of strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.
If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.
The function handles this case automatically because Python's string slicing does not raise an error if the end index of the slice is beyond the end of the string.
Instead, it returns all characters up to the end of the string, which is the desired behavior in this case.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code, which is splitting a string into groups of `n` characters using list comprehension and string slicing, has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features, making the code concise and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: Both list comprehension and string slicing in Python are implemented efficiently.
Therefore, this method can handle large inputs and perform well in terms of time complexity.

3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer, which is a good practice to ensure the validity of the input.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Memory Usage**: For very large strings, this method might be memory-intensive as it creates a new list that contains all the characters of the input string.
This could potentially lead to memory issues if the input string is extremely large.

2. **Lack of Flexibility**: The method is specifically designed to split a string into groups of `n` characters.
If you need to split a string based on different criteria (like a specific character or a regular expression), this method would not be applicable and would need to be modified.

3. **No In-place Operation**: The method does not perform the operation in-place.
It creates a new list and does not modify the original string.
If memory usage is a concern, an in-place operation might be more desirable.
However, it's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, so in-place modification is not possible for the input string itself.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the function `split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]` can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
This is because the function iterates over the string once, performing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.
The slicing operation in Python takes O(k) time where k is the size of the slice.
However, since the size of the slice is a constant (the group size `n`), this operation can be considered to take constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is linear.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
This is because the function creates a new list that contains all the characters of the input string.
In the worst-case scenario, if the group size `n` is 1, the function will create a list that contains all the characters of the input string, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
Therefore, the overall space complexity of the function is linear.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the string slicing and list comprehension operations in Python are implemented efficiently.
If these operations are not implemented efficiently in the Python interpreter you are using, the actual time and space complexity may be higher.

==== Code Review

The code in question is a Python function `split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]` from the file `solution_00.py`.

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is quite readable and easy to understand.
It uses descriptive function and variable names.
The function is broken down into small, manageable chunks, each performing a specific task.

2. **Maintainability**: The function is easy to extend and change.
It has a clear separation of concerns, with each part of the function performing a specific task.

3. **Security**: The function does not seem to have any security implications or potential vulnerabilities.
It does not interact with any external systems or configurations.

4. **Speed and Performance**: The function uses Python's built-in list comprehension and slicing, which are generally efficient.
However, for very large strings, this approach might be memory-intensive as it creates a new list.

5. **Documentation**: The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes doctests for testing the function.

6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: The function leverages Python's built-in features and does not reinvent the wheel.

7. **Reliability**: The function includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer and raises a `ValueError` otherwise.

8. **Scalability**: The function should scale well for larger inputs as it uses Python's built-in features which are generally optimized for performance.

9. **Reusability**: The function is general-purpose and can be reused in different contexts where a string needs to be split into groups of `n` characters.

10. **Patterns**: The function adheres to Python's standard conventions and style guide (PEP 8).

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: The test coverage and quality cannot be determined from the provided code.
However, the function includes doctests which can be used for basic testing.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The function appears to provide the intended functionality of splitting a string into groups of `n` characters.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The function handles the case where `n` is not a positive integer.
However, it does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the length of the string.
This is not necessarily a problem, but it might be worth documenting this behavior in the function's docstring.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of the function is appropriate and efficient for the task of splitting a string into groups of `n` characters.
The function is simple, straightforward, and uses Python's built-in features effectively.

=== Solution 01

include::./solution_01.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The code provided is a Python function named `split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]`.
This function is designed to split a given string `s` into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
It takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`.
The string `s` is the input string that needs to be split, and `n` is the size of the groups.

The function begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is not a positive integer, the function raises a `ValueError`.
This is done to ensure that the group size is valid.
Here is the code snippet that performs this check:

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

After validating the input, the function uses the `re.findall()` function from the `re` (regex) module to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
The `re.findall()` function is used with a regular expression that matches any `n` characters to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
Here is the code snippet that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
return re.findall(f'.{{1,{n}}}', s)
----

The result is a list of strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.
If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.
The function handles this case automatically because the `re.findall()` function does not raise an error if the end index of the slice is beyond the end of the string.
Instead, it returns all characters up to the end of the string, which is the desired behavior in this case.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code, which is splitting a string into groups of `n` characters using the `re.findall()` function from the `re` (regex) module, has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features, making the code concise and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: The `re.findall()` function in Python is implemented efficiently.
Therefore, this method can handle large inputs and perform well in terms of time complexity.

3. **Flexibility**: The method is flexible and can be easily adapted to split a string based on different criteria (like a specific character or a regular expression), by modifying the regular expression used in the `re.findall()` function.

4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer, which is a good practice to ensure the validity of the input.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Memory Usage**: For very large strings, this method might be memory-intensive as it creates a new list that contains all the characters of the input string.
This could potentially lead to memory issues if the input string is extremely large.

2. **Dependency on the `re` Module**: The method relies on the `re` module in Python.
If the `re` module is not available or if the regular expression used in the `re.findall()` function is not supported, this method would not work.

3. **No In-place Operation**: The method does not perform the operation in-place.
It creates a new list and does not modify the original string.
If memory usage is a concern, an in-place operation might be more desirable.
However, it's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, so in-place modification is not possible for the input string itself.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `split_string_into_groups` function in the `solution_01.py` file can be analyzed as follows:

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function uses the `re.findall()` function to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
The `re.findall()` function scans through the string and returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.
The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.
Therefore, the time complexity is linear.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function returns a list of strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.
In the worst-case scenario, if `n` is 1, the function will return a list that contains the same number of elements as the length of the input string.
Therefore, the space complexity is linear.

include::./solution_03.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code is a function named `split_string_into_groups` that splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_03.py`.

[source,python]
----
def split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]:
----

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then initializes an empty list `result` to store the groups and an empty string `group` to store the current group.
It iterates over each character in the string `s`, adding the current character to the current group.

[source,python]
----
for c in s:
    group += c
----

If the current group has `n` characters, it adds the group to the `result` list and resets the `group` string.
After the loop, if there are any remaining characters in the `group` string, it adds the group to the `result` list.

[source,python]
----
if len(group) == n:
    result.append(group)
    group = ''
----

Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which is a list of strings where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string `s`.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.

The time and space complexity of the `split_string_into_groups` function can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
This is because the function iterates over the string once, performing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.
The string concatenation operation inside the loop takes constant time, so the overall time complexity of the function is linear.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
This is because the function creates a new list `result` that can potentially contain all the characters of the input string in the worst-case scenario (when the group size `n` is 1).
Therefore, the space complexity is linear.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the string concatenation operation in Python is implemented efficiently.
If this operation is not implemented efficiently in the Python interpreter you are using, the actual time and space complexity may be higher.

=== Solution 04

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_04.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code is a generator function named `split_string_into_groups` that splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_04.py`.

[source,python]
----
def split_string_into_groups(string: str, n: int) -> Generator[str, None, None]:
----

The function takes two parameters: `string`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then uses a loop to iterate over the string with a step size of `n`.
In each iteration, it yields the next group of `n` characters from the string.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(0, len(string), n):
    yield string[i:i + n]
----

This is done using Python's built-in slicing feature, which allows you to get a substring from a string.
The start of the substring is `i` (the current index in the loop), and the end of the substring is `i + n` (the current index plus the group size).

The function is a generator function, which means it does not return all the groups at once, but instead yields them one by one.
This can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the groups, especially for large strings and small group sizes.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.
It uses a generator to yield the groups one by one, which can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the groups.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code, which is splitting a string into groups of `n` characters using a generator function and string slicing, has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features, making the code concise and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: The function uses a loop and string slicing, which are generally efficient in Python.

3. **Memory Management**: The function is a generator function, which means it does not return all the groups at once, but instead yields them one by one.
This can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the groups, especially for large strings and small group sizes.

4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer, which is a good practice to ensure the validity of the input.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Memory Usage**: For very large strings, this method might still be memory-intensive as it creates a new string for each group.

2. **Lack of Flexibility**: The method is specifically designed to split a string into groups of `n` characters.
If you need to split a string based on different criteria (like a specific character or a regular expression), this method would not be applicable and would need to be modified.

3. **No In-place Operation**: The method does not perform the operation in-place.
It creates new strings and does not modify the original string.
If memory usage is a concern, an in-place operation might be more desirable.
However, it's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, so in-place modification is not possible for the input string itself.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `split_string_into_groups` function in the `solution_04.py` file can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function iterates over the string once, performing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.
The slicing operation in Python takes O(k) time where k is the size of the slice.
However, since the size of the slice is a constant (the group size `n`), this operation can be considered to take constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is linear.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function creates a new string for each group.
In the worst-case scenario, if the group size `n` is 1, the function will create a new string for each character of the input string, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
Therefore, the overall space complexity of the function is linear.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the string slicing operation in Python is implemented efficiently.
If this operation is not implemented efficiently in the Python interpreter you are using, the actual time and space complexity may be higher.

This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_05.py`.

[source,python]
----
def split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> Iterator[str]:
----

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then creates an iterator from the input string and uses the `islice` function from the `itertools` module to yield groups of `n` characters from the iterator.

[source,python]
----
it = iter(s)
while True:
    group = ''.join(islice(it, n))
----

The `islice` function returns an iterator that yields the next `n` items from the input iterator.
The `join` method is used to concatenate the characters into a string.
If the `islice` function returns no items (which happens when all characters from the input string have been consumed), the function breaks out of the loop.

[source,python]
----
if not group:
    break
yield group
----

The function is a generator function, which means it does not return all the groups at once, but instead yields them one by one.
This can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the groups, especially for large strings and small group sizes.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function creates a new string for each group.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")

The function then converts the input string into a list of characters.
If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, it adds extra empty strings to the list to make its length a multiple of `n`.

[source,python]
----
chars = list(s)
if len(s) % n != 0:
    chars += [''] * (n - len(s) % n)

Next, the function uses the `numpy.reshape()` function to reshape the list of characters into a 2D array, where each row contains `n` characters.

[source,python]
----
arr = np.array(chars).reshape(-1, n)
----

Finally, the function converts each row of the 2D array back into a string and adds it to the result list.
The `rstrip()` method is used to remove any trailing empty strings that were added earlier.

=== Solution 08

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_08.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code is a function named `split_string_into_groups` that splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_08.py`.

[source,python]
----
def split_string_into_groups(s: str, n: int) -> list[str]:
----

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then uses the `chunked` method from the `more_itertools` library to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
The `chunked` method is a utility function that splits an iterable into chunks of a specified size.

[source,python]
----
chunks = more_itertools.chunked(s, n)
----

Next, the function converts each chunk into a string and adds it to the result list.
This is done using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.

[source,python]
----
result = [''.join(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
----

Finally, the function returns the result list, which is a list of strings where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.
It uses the `more_itertools` library to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code, which is splitting a string into groups of `n` characters using the `more_itertools.chunked()` function, has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features and the `more_itertools` library, making the code concise and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: The function uses the `more_itertools.chunked()` function, which is generally efficient in Python.

3. **Memory Management**: The function creates a new list of groups, but it does not create a new string for each group, which can be more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the groups, especially for large strings and small group sizes.

4. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer, which is a good practice to ensure the validity of the input.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Dependency**: The method relies on `more_itertools`, which is an external library.
This means that the code has an external dependency, which could potentially lead to issues if `more_itertools` is not installed or if there are compatibility issues with the version of `more_itertools` being used.

2. **Lack of Flexibility**: The method is specifically designed to split a string into groups of `n` characters.
If you need to split a string based on different criteria (like a specific character or a regular expression), this method would not be applicable and would need to be modified.

3. **No In-place Operation**: The method does not perform the operation in-place.
It creates new strings and does not modify the original string.
If memory usage is a concern, an in-place operation might be more desirable.
However, it's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, so in-place modification is not possible for the input string itself.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `split_string_into_groups` function in the `solution_08.py` file can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function iterates over the string once to convert it into a list of characters, which takes O(n) time.
The function then uses the `more_itertools.chunked()` function, which also operates in O(n) time as it needs to visit each element once.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is linear.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function creates a new list of characters from the input string, which takes O(n) space.
The function then creates a list of chunks from the list of characters, which also takes O(n) space.
Therefore, the overall space complexity of the function is linear.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the `more_itertools.chunked()` function and list operations in Python are implemented efficiently.
If these operations are not implemented efficiently in the Python interpreter you are using, the actual time and space complexity may be higher.

=== Solution 12

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_12.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python code is a function named `split_string_into_groups` that splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_12.py`.

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then uses list comprehension, `map`, `join`, and `zip` to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
It creates `n` copies of the same iterator and groups them together.

[source,python]
----
result = [''.join(chunk) for chunk in zip(*[iter(s)] * n)]
----

If the string length is not a multiple of `n`, it adds the remaining characters to the result.
This is done by calculating the remainder of the string length divided by `n` and appending the last `remainder` characters of the string to the result.

[source,python]
----
remainder = len(s) % n
if remainder != 0:
    result.append(s[-remainder:])
----

Finally, the function returns the result list, which is a list of strings where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.
It uses Python's built-in features effectively.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code, which is splitting a string into groups of `n` characters using the `itertools.zip_longest()` function, has several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features and the `itertools` library, making the code concise and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: The function uses the `itertools.zip_longest()` function, which is generally efficient in Python.
However, for very large strings, this approach might be memory-intensive as it creates a new list of groups.

3. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to check if `n` is a positive integer, which is a good practice to ensure the validity of the input.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Dependency**: The method relies on `itertools`, which is a built-in Python library.
This means that the code has a dependency, which could potentially lead to issues if there are compatibility issues with the version of Python being used.

2. **Lack of Flexibility**: The method is specifically designed to split a string into groups of `n` characters.
If you need to split a string based on different criteria (like a specific character or a regular expression), this method would not be applicable and would need to be modified.

3. **No In-place Operation**: The method does not perform the operation in-place.
It creates new strings and does not modify the original string.
If memory usage is a concern, an in-place operation might be more desirable.
However, it's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, so in-place modification is not possible for the input string itself.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the `split_string_into_groups` function in the `solution_12.py` file can be analyzed as follows:

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function iterates over the string once to convert it into a list of characters, which takes O(n) time.
The function then uses the `zip` function, which also operates in O(n) time as it needs to visit each element once.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is linear.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function creates a new list of characters from the input string, which takes O(n) space.
The function then creates a list of chunks from the list of characters, which also takes O(n) space.
Therefore, the overall space complexity of the function is linear.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the `zip` function and list operations in Python are implemented efficiently.
If these operations are not implemented efficiently in the Python interpreter you are using, the actual time and space complexity may be higher.

This function is designed to split a given string `s` into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

1. **Readability (Understandability)**: The code is quite readable and easy to understand.
It uses descriptive function and variable names.
The function is broken down into small, manageable chunks, each performing a specific task.

2. **Maintainability**: The function is easy to extend and change.

==== Explanation

The provided Python code is a function named `split_string_into_groups` that splits a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters using recursion.
This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_13.py`.

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then uses recursion to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
It checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to `n`.
If it is, it returns a list containing the string `s`.

[source,python]
----
if len(s) <= n:
    return [s]
----

If the length of the string is greater than `n`, it splits the string into two parts: the first `n` characters and the rest of the string.
It then recursively calls `split_string_into_groups` on the rest of the string.

[source,python]
----
return [s[:n]] + split_string_into_groups(s[n:], n)
----

Finally, the function returns a list of strings where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters.

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.
It uses Python's built-in features effectively and demonstrates the use of recursion for solving this problem.

This function is part of a module in a file named `solution_14.py`.

The function takes two parameters: `s`, the input string to be split, and `n`, the size of the groups.
It begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the group size must be a positive integer.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("The group size must be a positive integer")
----

The function then converts the string into a list of characters.
This is done using the built-in `list` function in Python.

[source,python]
----
chars = list(s)
----

Next, the function calculates the number of bins or groups that will be created.
This is done by integer division of the length of the characters list by `n`.
If the length of the characters list is not a multiple of `n`, an additional bin is added to account for the remaining characters.

[source,python]
----
bins = len(chars) // n if len(chars) % n == 0 else len(chars) // n + 1
----

The function then uses the `pandas.cut()` function to split the range of indices of the characters list into bins.
The `labels=False` argument is used to return integer indicators of the bins.

[source,python]
----
cut = pd.cut(range(len(chars)), bins, labels=False)
----

Finally, the function groups the characters by the cut and joins each group into a string.
This is done using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.
The function then returns the list of groups.

[source,python]
----
groups = [''.join(chars[i] for i in range(len(chars)) if cut[i] == bin) for bin in range(bins)]
return groups
----

The function is well-documented with a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and raises conditions.
It also includes examples and doctests for testing the function.
This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the function.

In summary, this Python function provides a simple and efficient solution to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, with appropriate error handling and documentation.
It uses Python's built-in features and the pandas library effectively.
