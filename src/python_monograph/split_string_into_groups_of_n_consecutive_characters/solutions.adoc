= {description}

== Approaches

1. **Using List Comprehension and Slicing**: This is a simple and straightforward approach where we can use Python's slicing feature to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.
We can use list comprehension to iterate over the string with a step size of `n` and slice the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.

2. **Using the `re` (regex) Module**: Python's `re` module provides a function called `findall()`, which can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
We can use this function with a regular expression that matches any `n` characters to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

3. **Using the `textwrap` Module**: The `textwrap` module in Python provides a function called `wrap()`, which can be used to split a string into a list of output lines of specified width.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

4. **Using a Loop and String Concatenation**: We can also solve this problem by manually looping over the string and concatenating `n` characters at a time to a new string.
Once we have `n` characters, we can add the new string to a list and reset the new string to an empty string.

5. **Using Generator Function**: We can create a generator function that takes a string and a number `n` as input and yields chunks of `n` characters from the string.
This approach is memory efficient as it doesn't require storing all chunks in memory at once.

6. **Using `itertools`**: The `itertools` module in Python provides a function called `islice()`, which can be used to slice an iterable.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

7. **Using `numpy`**: We can also use the `numpy` library to solve this problem.
We can convert the string to a `numpy` array and then use the `reshape()` function to split the array into chunks of `n` characters.

8. **Using `pandas`**: The `pandas` library in Python provides a function called `cut()`, which can be used to split an array into bins.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

9. **Using `more_itertools`**: The `more_itertools` library provides a function called `chunked()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

10. **Using `toolz`**: The `toolz` library provides a function called `partition_all()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

11. **Using `cytoolz`**: The `cytoolz` library provides a function called `partition_all()`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

12. **Using `itertools`**: The `itertools` library provides a function called `zip_longest`, which can be used to split an iterable into chunks of a specified size.
We can use this function to split the string into chunks of `n` characters.

13. **Using `list` + `map` + `join` + `zip`**: We can also solve this problem using the `list` function, the `map` function, the `join` method, and the `zip` function.
We can use the `map` function to iterate over the string with a step size of `n` and slice the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.
We can then use the `zip` function to combine the chunks into a list of tuples, and the `join` method to join the tuples into a list of strings.

14. **Using Recursion with Slicing**: We can also solve this problem using recursion and slicing.
We can define a recursive function that takes a string and a number `n` as input and returns a list of chunks of `n` characters.
The function can slice the string into chunks of `n` characters and call itself recursively with the remaining string until the string is empty.

== Performance Optimizations

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations**: If the function performs any unnecessary operations, such as creating temporary lists or strings, these should be eliminated to improve performance.

2. **Use Built-in Functions and Libraries**: Python's built-in functions and libraries are usually optimized for performance.
If there are built-in functions or libraries that can be used to solve the problem, they should be used instead of custom code.

3. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: The choice of data structures can significantly impact the performance of a function.
For example, if the function needs to check if an element is in a collection, a set should be used instead of a list because checking membership is faster in a set.

4. **Use Lazy Evaluation**: If the function generates a large number of results, it may be more efficient to use a generator that yields the results one at a time instead of a function that returns a list of all results.

5. **Use Caching/Memoization**: If the function performs expensive computations that are repeated with the same inputs, these computations should be cached to avoid unnecessary work.

6. **Avoid Recursion**: Recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative functions due to the overhead of function calls.
If the function is recursive, it may be more efficient to rewrite it as an iterative function.

7. **Use Vectorized Operations**: If the function performs operations on arrays or matrices, it may be more efficient to use vectorized operations provided by libraries like NumPy.

8. **Parallelize Computations**: If the function performs independent computations that can be executed in parallel, these computations should be parallelized to take advantage of multiple cores or processors.

9. **Profile and Optimize Hotspots**: Use a profiler to identify the parts of the function that consume the most time (hotspots) and focus optimization efforts on these parts.

10. **Use Just-In-Time Compilation**: If the function is computationally intensive and called many times, using a just-in-time compiler like Numba can significantly improve performance.

== Solutions

=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The provided Python function, `split_string_into_groups`, takes two arguments: a string `string` and an integer `n`.
The purpose of this function is to split the input string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

The function begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "Group size should be a positive integer".
This is done to ensure that the group size is valid.

[source,python]
----
if n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Group size should be a positive integer")
----

The main logic of the function uses Python's list comprehension and string slicing features.
It iterates over the string with a step size of `n` and slices the string from the current index to the current index plus `n`.
This is done using the expression `string[i:i + n]` inside the list comprehension.

[source,python]
----
string[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(string), n)
----

Each sliced string is then added to a set.
The use of a set here is to remove any duplicate groups.
However, it's important to note that this operation does not preserve the original order of the groups.
If the order is important, a different approach would be needed.

Finally, the set is converted back to a list and returned as the result of the function.
This is done using the `list()` function.

[source,python]
----
return list(set(string[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(string), n)))
----

In summary, this function splits a given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters, removes any duplicate groups, and returns the unique groups as a list.
It raises an error if the group size is not a positive integer.

This makes the function reliable as it validates its input.

8. **Scalability**: The function should scale well for larger inputs as it has a linear time complexity.

9. **Reusability**: The function is general-purpose and can be reused in different contexts.

10. **Patterns**: The function follows common Python patterns and style.

11. **Test Coverage and Quality**: Not applicable in this context as no tests are provided with the function.

12. **Fit for Purpose**: The function appears to meet its intended purpose of splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.

13. **Notice What's Missing**: The function does not preserve the original order of the groups.
If the order is important, a different approach would be needed.

14. **Zoom Out**: The overall approach of using list comprehension and string slicing to split the string into groups is appropriate and efficient for this problem.

In conclusion, the function is well-written and follows many best practices.
However, there is room for improvement in terms of performance for large inputs and handling of the original order of the groups.

==== Advantages & Disadvantages

The method used in the code from `solution_00.py` is a combination of list comprehension, string slicing, and set operations to split a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
Here are the advantages and disadvantages of this method:

Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python features, making the code concise and readable.
2. **Efficiency**: List comprehension and string slicing in Python are generally fast and efficient.
3. **Removal of Duplicates**: The use of a set ensures that any duplicate groups are removed.

Disadvantages:
1. **Order Not Preserved**: The use of a set does not preserve the original order of the groups.
If the order is important, this method would not be suitable.
2. **Not Suitable for Large Inputs**: Converting a list to a set can be memory-intensive for large inputs.
If the string is very large, this method might be inefficient.
3. **Inefficiency in Removing Duplicates**: If there are no duplicates in the original string or if preserving duplicates is desired, converting to a set is an unnecessary step that could slow down the function.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the function `split_string_into_groups` in the `solution_02.py` file can be analyzed as follows:

Time Complexity:
The function uses the `textwrap.wrap()` function to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
This operation is performed in a single pass over the string, so the time complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the string.

Space Complexity:
The function creates a new list to store the groups of characters.
In the worst-case scenario, the string is split into individual characters, resulting in a list of size m.
Therefore, the space complexity is also O(m), where m is the length of the string.

In summary, both the time and space complexity of the function are linear in terms of the length of the input string.

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[lines=21..]
----

==== Explanation

The code in `solution_02.py` is a Python script that contains a function for splitting a string into groups of `n` consecutive characters.
The function is named `split_string_into_groups` and it uses the `textwrap` module from Python's standard library.

The `split_string_into_groups` function takes two arguments: a string and an integer `n`.
The string is the input that needs to be split, and `n` is the number of consecutive characters in each group.

The function starts by importing the `textwrap` module.
This module provides a function called `wrap()`, which is used to split the string into a list of output lines of specified width.

[source,python]
----
import textwrap
----

Inside the function, the `textwrap.wrap()` function is used to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
The `wrap()` function takes two arguments: the string to be split and the width of the output lines.
In this case, the width is `n`, which is the number of consecutive characters in each group.

[source,python]
----
textwrap.wrap(string, n)
----

The `wrap()` function returns a list of output lines.
Each line in the list is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.
If the length of the string is not a multiple of `n`, the last group may contain less than `n` characters.

In summary, the `split_string_into_groups` function in `solution_02.py` splits a given string into groups of `n` consecutive characters using the `wrap()` function from Python's `textwrap` module.
The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a group of `n` consecutive characters from the input string.

2. **Performance**: While the `textwrap.wrap()` function is generally efficient, it can be slower than some other methods (like string slicing or regular expressions) for large inputs.
3. **Lack of Flexibility**: The `textwrap` module is designed for formatting text and may not offer the same level of flexibility or control as other methods, such as regular expressions or manual string manipulation.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of the function `split_string_into_groups` in both `solution_01.py` and `solution_02.py` can be analyzed as follows:

Time Complexity:
The function uses either the `re.findall()` function or the `textwrap.wrap()` function to split the string into groups of `n` characters.
