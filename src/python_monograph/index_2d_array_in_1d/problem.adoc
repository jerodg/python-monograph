== Use-Case(s)

The `Index2DArrayIterator` class is designed to provide an iterator for a 2D array.
This can be useful in a variety of scenarios where you need to process or manipulate data in a 2D array in a sequential manner.
Here are some common use cases:

1. **Iterating through a 2D array**: The most straightforward use case is to iterate through all elements in a 2D array.
This can be useful when you need to process each element in the array, such as calculating the sum or finding the maximum or minimum value.

2. **Converting a 2D array to a 1D array**: If you need to convert a 2D array to a 1D array, you can use the `Index2DArrayIterator` to iterate through all elements in the 2D array and append them to a new 1D array.

3. **Searching for an element in a 2D array**: If you need to check if a certain value exists in a 2D array, you can use the `Index2DArrayIterator` to iterate through all elements in the array and check if the value exists.

4. **Applying a function to each element in a 2D array**: If you need to apply a function to each element in a 2D array, you can use the `Index2DArrayIterator` to iterate through all elements in the array and apply the function.

5. **Sorting a 2D array**: If you need to sort the elements in a 2D array, you can use the `Index2DArrayIterator` to iterate through all elements in the array, sort them, and then reconstruct the 2D array.

Remember, the `Index2DArrayIterator` class provides a way to iterate over a 2D array as if it were a 1D array, which can simplify many operations that you might want to perform on a 2D array.
