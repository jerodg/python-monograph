            arr (List[dict]):

    return list(set(chain.from_iterable(sub.keys() for sub in arr)))
----

==== Explanation

The code above is a Python function named `method_0` that takes a list of dictionaries (`arr`) as an argument and returns a list of unique keys from all dictionaries in the list.

The function uses the `chain` function from the `itertools` module to flatten the list of keys from all dictionaries.
This is done by the line `chain.from_iterable(sub.keys() for sub in arr)`.
Here, a generator expression is used to iterate over each dictionary in the list `arr` and get its keys.
The `chain.from_iterable` function then flattens this list of keys into a single iterable.

After the keys have been flattened into a single iterable, the function converts this iterable of keys into a set, effectively removing any duplicate keys since sets only contain unique elements.
This is done by the line `set(...)`.

Finally, the function converts the set of unique keys back into a list, which is then returned by the function.
This is done by the line `list(...)`.

In terms of complexity, the time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the `chain` function and the `set` function.
The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is due to the storage of all keys in a set and a list.

The function is efficient in finding all unique keys in a list of dictionaries.
However, it creates several intermediate data structures (a generator, a set, and a list), which can consume more memory when dealing with large inputs.

===== Advantages

- The use of `itertools.chain` makes the code concise and easy to understand.
It allows the function to handle the keys from all dictionaries in a single line of code.
- The function effectively finds all unique keys in a list of dictionaries.
By converting the list of keys to a set, it automatically removes any duplicate keys.
===== Disadvantages
- The function creates several intermediate data structures (a generator, a set, and a list), which can consume more memory when dealing with large inputs.
This could potentially lead to performance issues if the list of dictionaries is very large.
- The function does not preserve the order of the keys.
If the order of keys is important, this method would not be suitable.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the chain function and the set function.
The chain function iterates over each key in the list of dictionaries, and the set function also iterates over each key to remove duplicates.
====== Space The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is due to the storage of all keys in a set and a list.
The chain function creates a generator, which is a lazy iterator and does not consume memory for all items at once.
However, the set and the list created in the function store all keys, leading to a space complexity of O(n).

----

==== Explanation The code in question is a Python function named `method_0`.

This function is designed to take a list of dictionaries as an input and return a list of unique keys from all the dictionaries in the list.

The function begins by using the `chain` function from Python's `itertools` module.
This is done in the line `chain.from_iterable(sub.keys() for sub in arr)`.
Here, a generator expression is used to iterate over each dictionary in the list `arr` and extract its keys.
The `chain.from_iterable` function then takes these keys and flattens them into a single iterable.

Once the keys have been flattened into a single iterable, the function then converts this iterable into a set.
This is achieved with the line `set(...)`.
The purpose of this step is to remove any duplicate keys, as sets in Python only contain unique elements.

Finally, the function converts the set of unique keys back into a list.
This is done with the line `list(...)`.
The list of unique keys is then returned by the function.

In terms of complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the `chain` function and the `set` function.
The space complexity is also O(n), due to the storage of all keys in a set and a list.

While the function is efficient in finding all unique keys in a list of dictionaries, it does create several intermediate data structures (a generator, a set, and a list), which can consume more memory when dealing with large inputs.
===== Advantages - The use of `itertools.chain` makes the code concise and easy to understand.

===== Disadvantages - The function creates several intermediate data structures (a generator, a set, and a list), which can consume more memory when dealing with large inputs.

- The function does not preserve the order of the keys.
If the order of keys is important, this method would not be suitable.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the list comprehension and the set function.
The list comprehension iterates over each key in the list of dictionaries, and the set function also iterates over each key to remove duplicates.
====== Space The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is due to the storage of all keys in a list and a set.
The list comprehension creates a list, which consumes memory for all items at once.
However, the set created in the function stores all keys, leading to a space complexity of O(n).

    """Method 2: Using keys(),extend(),list() and set() methods

    Args:
            arr (List[dict]):

    Returns:
            (list)"""
    new_list = []

    for i in arr:
        new_list.extend(list(i.keys()))

    return list(set(new_list))
----

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_2`.

This function is designed to extract all unique keys from a list of dictionaries.

The function starts by initializing an empty list `new_list`.
This list will be used to store all keys from all dictionaries in the input list.

The function then enters a loop where it iterates over each dictionary in the input list `arr`.
For each dictionary, it extracts the keys using the `keys()` method, converts them into a list, and extends `new_list` with this list of keys.
This is done in the line `new_list.extend(list(i.keys()))`.

At this point, `new_list` contains all keys from all dictionaries, possibly with duplicates.
To remove these duplicates, the function converts `new_list` into a set.
Since sets in Python only contain unique elements, this effectively removes any duplicate keys.
This is done in the line `set(new_list)`.

Finally, the function converts the set of unique keys back into a list and returns this list.
This is done in the line `list(set(new_list))`.

In terms of complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the loop and the `set` function.
The space complexity is also O(n), due to the storage of all keys in `new_list` and a set.
===== Advantages - The function is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses basic Python constructs like for loops and list methods, which makes it accessible to developers with a basic understanding of Python.
- The function effectively finds all unique keys in a list of dictionaries.
By extending a list with the keys from each dictionary and then converting this list to a set, it automatically removes any duplicate keys.
===== Disadvantages - The function creates several intermediate data structures (a list for each dictionary's keys, a combined list of all keys, and a set), which can consume more memory when dealing with large inputs.
This could potentially lead to performance issues if the list of dictionaries is very large.
- The function does not preserve the order of the keys.
If the order of keys is important, this method would not be suitable.
- The function iterates over the list of dictionaries twice: once to create the combined list of keys, and once to create the set.
This could potentially slow down the function if the list of dictionaries is very large.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the loop and the set function.
The loop iterates over each dictionary in the list arr, and for each dictionary, it extracts its keys and extends new_list with this list of keys.
The set function also iterates over each key in new_list to remove duplicates.
====== Space The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is due to the storage of all keys in new_list and a set.
The loop creates a list for each dictionary's keys and extends new_list with this list of keys.
After all dictionaries have been processed, new_list contains all keys from all dictionaries, possibly with duplicates.
The set function then creates a set, which stores all unique keys from new_list.

def method_3(arr: List[dict]) -> list:
    """Method 3: Using functools.reduce()

    Args:
            arr (List[dict]):

    Returns:
            (list)"""
    return list(reduce(lambda a, b: {**a, **b}, arr).keys())
----

==== Explanation The selected code is a Python function named `method_3`.

This function is designed to extract all unique keys from a list of dictionaries.

The function uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module. `reduce` applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output.
In this case, the function being applied is a lambda function that merges two dictionaries into one.
This is done in the line `reduce(lambda a, b: {**a, **b}, arr)`.

The lambda function `lambda a, b: {**a, **b}` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are dictionaries.
It returns a new dictionary that is the result of merging `a` and `b`.
The `{**a, **b}` syntax is a shorthand for creating a new dictionary and unpacking the keys and values of `a` and `b` into it.

After `reduce` has been applied, the result is a single dictionary that contains all keys and values from all dictionaries in the input list `arr`.
This dictionary may still contain duplicate keys.

To extract the unique keys from this dictionary, the function uses the `keys()` method, which returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys.
This is done in the line `...keys()`.

Finally, the function converts the view object into a list and returns this list.
This is done in the line `list(...)`.

In terms of complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the `reduce` function and the `keys()` method.
The space complexity is also O(n), due to the storage of all keys in a single dictionary.
===== Advantages - The function is concise and efficient.
It uses the `reduce` function to merge all dictionaries into one, which simplifies the process of finding unique keys.
- The function effectively finds all unique keys in a list of dictionaries.
By merging all dictionaries into one and then extracting the keys, it automatically removes any duplicate keys.
- The use of `reduce` and a lambda function makes the code more Pythonic and easier to understand for developers familiar with these concepts.
===== Disadvantages - The function creates an intermediate dictionary that contains all keys and values from all dictionaries in the input list.
This could potentially consume a lot of memory when dealing with large inputs.
- The function does not preserve the order of the keys.
If the order of keys is important, this method would not be suitable.
- The use of `reduce` and a lambda function might make the code harder to understand for developers not familiar with these concepts.
===== Complexity Analysis ====== Time The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is because each key is processed once by the reduce function and the keys() method.
The reduce function applies a lambda function that merges two dictionaries into one, and for each merge operation, it iterates over each key in the dictionaries.
The keys() method also iterates over each key in the final merged dictionary to create a view object of all keys.
====== Space The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of keys in all dictionaries.
This is due to the storage of all keys in a single dictionary.
The reduce function creates a new dictionary that is the result of merging all dictionaries in the input list arr.
This dictionary contains all keys and values from all dictionaries, possibly with duplicates.
The keys() method then creates a view object, which is a lightweight object but still requires some space.
