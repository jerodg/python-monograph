    """Check if a list is monotonic using a single pass with flags.

    This function checks if a given list of integers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely
    non-increasing or non-decreasing.

    Args:
        nums (list[int]): The list of integers to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is monotonic, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> solution_01([1, 2, 2, 3])
        True
        >>> solution_01([6, 5, 4, 4])
        True
        >>> solution_01([1, 3, 2])
        False
