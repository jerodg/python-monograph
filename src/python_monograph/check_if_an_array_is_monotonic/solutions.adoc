== Solution(s)

[.lead]
=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The function `solution_00` is a Python function that checks if a given list of integers is monotonic.
A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.
The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_00(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
----

The function uses a generator expression and the built-in `all()` function to check if the list is monotonic.
This is known as the two-pass method.
The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the passed iterable are true.
Otherwise, it returns `False`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
all(nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1))
----

The generator expression `(nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1))` generates a sequence of boolean values representing whether each pair of consecutive elements in the list is in non-decreasing order.
If all pairs are in non-decreasing order, the `all()` function returns `True`.

The function performs this check twice: once for non-decreasing order and once for non-increasing order.
If either check returns `True`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonic.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return all(nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1)) or all(nums[i] >= nums[i + 1] for i in range(len(nums) - 1))
----

In summary, `solution_00` is a Python function that checks if a list of integers is monotonic using the two-pass method.
It performs two passes over the list: one to check for non-decreasing order and one to check for non-increasing order.
If either check succeeds, the function concludes that the list is monotonic.

==== Advantages

- **Simplicity**: The two-pass method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python functions and language features, making it accessible to developers familiar with Python.
- **Efficiency**: The two-pass method is efficient for lists that are already sorted or nearly sorted.
It can determine if a list is monotonic in linear time, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

==== Disadvantages

- **Performance**: The two-pass method may not be as efficient for large lists that are not sorted or nearly sorted.
It makes two passes over the list, which can be costly for large lists.
- **Memory Usage**: The two-pass method uses a generator expression, which can consume a significant amount of memory for large lists.
This could be a concern in memory-constrained environments.

In summary, the two-pass method is a simple and efficient solution for checking if a list is monotonic, but it may not be the best choice for large, unsorted lists due to its potential memory usage and performance characteristics.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the selected code is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
This is because the code makes two passes over the list, each of which takes linear time.

The space complexity of the selected code is O(1).
This is because the code uses a fixed amount of space to store the input list and a few variables, and this space usage does not change with the size of the input list.

NOTE: that the generator expressions used in the `all()` functions do not consume space for each element in the list, as they generate each boolean value on the fly and do not store them.
Therefore, they do not contribute to the space complexity.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The function `solution_01` is a Python function that checks if a given list of integers is monotonic.
A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.
The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_01(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
----

The function uses two boolean flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to keep track of whether the list is non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively.
Initially, both flags are set to `True`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
increasing = decreasing = True
----

The function then iterates over the list, comparing each pair of consecutive elements.
If the current element is greater than the next element, the `increasing` flag is set to `False`.
If the current element is less than the next element, the `decreasing` flag is set to `False`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
    if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
        increasing = False
    if nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:
        decreasing = False
----

Finally, the function returns `True` if either the `increasing` or `decreasing` flag is still `True`, indicating that the list is monotonic.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return increasing or decreasing
----

In summary, `solution_01` is a Python function that checks if a list of integers is monotonic using a single pass with flags.
It iterates over the list, comparing each pair of consecutive elements and updating the `increasing` and `decreasing` flags as necessary.
If either flag is still `True` at the end of the iteration, the function concludes that the list is monotonic.

==== Advantages

Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: The single-pass with flags method is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses basic Python language features, making it accessible to developers familiar with Python.
- **Efficiency**: The single-pass with flags method is efficient as it only makes one pass over the list, which can be beneficial for large lists.
It can determine if a list is monotonic in linear time, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

==== Disadvantages

- **Performance**: While the single-pass with flags method is efficient, it may not be as efficient for lists that are already sorted or nearly sorted.
This is because it still makes a full pass over the list, even if the list is already sorted.
- **Memory Usage**: The single-pass with flags method uses two boolean flags, which consume a small amount of memory.
However, this is negligible and should not be a concern in most environments.

NOTE: the single-pass with flags method is a simple and efficient solution for checking if a list is monotonic, but it may not be the best choice for lists that are already sorted or nearly sorted due to its performance characteristics.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the selected code is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
This is because the code makes a single pass over the list, which takes linear time.

The space complexity of the selected code is O(1).
This is because the code uses a fixed amount of space to store the input list and a few variables, and this space usage does not change with the size of the input list.
The boolean flags `increasing` and `decreasing` do not contribute significantly to the space complexity as they only take constant space.
