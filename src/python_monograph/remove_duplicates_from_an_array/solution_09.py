    This function removes duplicates from a given list using the pandas.unique() function approach.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.

    Returns:
        list: A new list with duplicates removed. The order of elements is preserved.

    Doctest:
        >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> remove_duplicates(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'e', 'e'])

    Note:
        This function preserves the original order of elements in the list.
