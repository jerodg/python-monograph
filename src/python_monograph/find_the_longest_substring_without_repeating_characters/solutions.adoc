[.lead]
=== Solution 00

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_00.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The code provided is a Python function named `solution_00`.
This function is designed to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
It uses a technique known as the sliding window technique.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_00(s: str) -> tuple[int, str]:
----

The function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string.
It returns a tuple containing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

The function starts by initializing three variables: `start`, `max_length`, and `used_chars`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
start = 0
max_length = 0
used_chars = {}
----

`start` is a pointer that represents the start of the window. `max_length` is used to store the length of the longest window encountered during the process. `used_chars` is a dictionary that keeps track of the last occurrence of each character.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the string with the `end` pointer.

[source,python,linenums]
----
for end in range(len(s)):
----

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current character is in the `used_chars` dictionary and if its last occurrence is in the current window.

[source,python,linenums]
----
if s[end] in used_chars and start <= used_chars[s[end]]:
----

If the current character is in the `used_chars` dictionary and its last occurrence is in the current window, the window contracts by moving the `start` pointer to the right of the last occurrence of the current character.

[source,python,linenums]
----
start = used_chars[s[end]] + 1
----

If the current character is not in the `used_chars` dictionary or if it is in the dictionary but its last occurrence is not in the current window, the window expands by moving the `end` pointer to the right.

[source,python,linenums]
----
else:
    max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
----

In both cases, the function updates the last occurrence of the current character in the `used_chars` dictionary.

[source,python,linenums]
----
used_chars[s[end]] = end
----

Finally, the function returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return max_length, s[start : start + max_length]
----

This function is a practical implementation of the sliding window technique, which is a common approach for solving substring problems in linear time.

==== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The sliding window technique is a very efficient way to solve this problem.
It only needs to iterate through the string once, which makes the time complexity of this algorithm O(n), where n is the length of the string.
This is significantly faster than a naive approach that would have a time complexity of O(n^2).
2. **Simplicity**: The sliding window technique is relatively simple to understand and implement.
It uses two pointers to represent the window and a dictionary to keep track of the last occurrence of each character.
This makes the code easy to read and maintain.
3. **Versatility**: The sliding window technique can be used to solve a variety of problems related to substrings, not just this specific problem.
This makes it a valuable tool in a developer's toolkit.

==== Disadvantages

1. **Space Complexity**: The sliding window technique uses a dictionary to keep track of the last occurrence of each character.
This means that the space complexity of this algorithm is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string.
In the worst-case scenario, where all characters are unique, the space complexity would be O(n).
2. **Dependence on Input**: The efficiency of the sliding window technique depends on the input.
If the string has many repeating characters, the window will often contract, which could lead to less efficient performance.
3. **Not In-place**: The sliding window technique is not an in-place algorithm.
It requires additional space to store the `used_chars` dictionary.
This might not be ideal for situations where memory is a concern.

==== Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
This is because the code iterates over the string once.
Each operation inside the loop, including the dictionary lookup and update, is a constant time operation.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the code is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string.
This is because a dictionary is used to keep track of the last occurrence of each character.
In the worst-case scenario, where all characters are unique, the space complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the string.

=== Solution 01

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_01.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided code is a Python function named `solution_01`.
This function is designed to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
It uses a data structure known as a deque to implement the sliding window technique.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_01(s: str) -> tuple[int, str]:
----

The function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string.
It returns a tuple containing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

The function starts by initializing a deque named `queue` and a variable `max_length`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
queue = deque()
max_length = 0
----

`queue` is used as a sliding window to keep track of the current substring without repeating characters. `max_length` is used to store the length of the longest substring encountered during the process.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the string.

[source,python,linenums]
----
for char in s:
----

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current character is in the `queue`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
while char in queue:
----

If the current character is in the `queue`, the function removes elements from the left of the deque until the deque does not contain the current character.

[source,python,linenums]
----
queue.popleft()
----

Then, the function appends the current character to the `queue`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
queue.append(char)
----

The function updates `max_length` with the maximum length of the `queue` encountered so far.

[source,python,linenums]
----
max_length = max(max_length, len(queue))
----

Finally, the function returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return max_length, "".join(list(queue))
----

This function is a practical implementation of the sliding window technique using a deque, which is a common approach for solving substring problems in linear time.

==== Advantages

Advantages:
1. **Efficiency**: The sliding window technique is a very efficient way to solve this problem.
It only needs to iterate through the string once, which makes the time complexity of this algorithm O(n), where n is the length of the string.
This is significantly faster than a naive approach that would have a time complexity of O(n^2).

1. **Space Complexity**: The sliding window technique uses a deque to keep track of the current substring.
This means that the space complexity of this algorithm is O(k), where k is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
In the worst-case scenario, where all characters are unique, the space complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the string.

3. **Not In-place**: The sliding window technique is not an in-place algorithm.
It requires additional space to store the deque.
This might not be ideal for situations where memory is a concern.

==== Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for the selected code are as follows:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
This is because the code iterates over the string once.
Each operation inside the loop, including the deque operations (append and popleft), is a constant time operation.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the code is O(k), where k is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
This is because a deque is used to keep track of the current substring.
In the worst-case scenario, where all characters are unique, the space complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the string.

=== Solution 02

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
include::./solution_02.py[]
----

==== Explanation

The provided code is a Python function named `solution_02`.
This function is designed to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
It uses a dictionary to implement the sliding window technique.

[source,python,linenums]
----
def solution_02(s: str) -> Tuple[int, str]:
----

The function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string.
It returns a tuple containing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

The function starts by initializing a few variables: `start`, `max_length`, `seen`, and `max_str`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
start = max_length = 0
seen = dict()
max_str = ""
----

`start` is used to keep track of the starting index of the current substring. `max_length` is used to store the length of the longest substring encountered during the process. `seen` is a dictionary that stores the last occurrence of each character. `max_str` stores the longest substring without repeating characters.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the string.

[source,python,linenums]
----
for i, c in enumerate(s):
----

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current character `c` is in the `seen` dictionary and if its value is greater than or equal to `start`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
if seen.get(c, -1) >= start:
    start = seen[c] + 1
----

If the condition is true, the function updates `start` to the index after the last occurrence of the current character.

The function then checks if the length of the current substring is greater than `max_length`.

[source,python,linenums]
----
if max_length < i - start + 1:
    max_length = i - start + 1
    max_str = s[start : i + 1]
----

If the condition is true, the function updates `max_length` and `max_str` with the length and the value of the current substring, respectively.

Finally, the function updates the `seen` dictionary with the current character and its index.

[source,python,linenums]
----
seen[c] = i
----

The function ends by returning the length of the longest substring without repeating characters and the substring itself.

[source,python,linenums]
----
return max_length, max_str
----

This function is a practical implementation of the sliding window technique using a dictionary, which is a common approach for solving substring problems in linear time.
