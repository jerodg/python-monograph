== Problem

[.lead]
Given a string `+s+`, find the length of the *longest* *substring* without repeating characters.

To solve this problem, you can use the sliding window technique.
Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to point to the beginning of the string.
2. Initialize a set to keep track of the unique characters in the current substring.
3. Move the `end` pointer to the right and add the character at the `end` to the set.
4. If the character at the `end` is already in the set, it means we have found a duplicate character.
In this case, move the `start` pointer to the right and remove the character at the `start` from the set.
Repeat this step until the duplicate character is removed from the set.
5. Update the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the `end` pointer reaches the end of the string.

Here is the Python code that implements this plan:

[source,python]
----

----

This function takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we are doing a single pass through the string.
The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, because we are storing each unique character in the set.

=== Best Practices

When optimizing the performance of the "Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, there are several best practices you can follow:

1. **Use the Right Data Structures**: In this case, a set is used to keep track of the unique characters in the current substring.
A set is an appropriate choice because it allows for constant time complexity for search and insert operations.

2. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations**: In the provided code, the `start` pointer is moved to the right until the duplicate character is removed from the set.
This operation is performed in a while loop, which can be costly if the string contains many repeated characters.
To optimize this, you could use a dictionary instead of a set to keep track of the characters and their indices.
This way, when a duplicate character is found, you can directly move the `start` pointer to the right of the duplicate character, avoiding unnecessary operations.

3. **Use Built-in Functions Wisely**: Python's built-in functions are usually optimized for performance.
For example, the `max` function is used to update the length of the longest substring.
This is more efficient than using an if statement to compare and update the length.

4. **Minimize Space Usage**: The space complexity of the code is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set.
If the character set is known and is small, this is not a problem.
However, if the character set is large, the space usage can be high.
To minimize space usage, you could use a bit vector instead of a set or dictionary if the character set is small and known (like ASCII).

5. **Use Efficient String Concatenation**: If you need to return the longest substring itself, not just its length, be aware that string concatenation in Python can be costly if not done correctly.
Instead of concatenating strings inside a loop, consider using a list to store the characters of the substring and then use the `join` method to concatenate them into a string.

Remember, the actual performance gain from these optimizations may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the input and the Python interpreter's implementation.
Always measure the performance before and after optimization to ensure that the changes have the desired effect.

=== Use-Cases

The problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters is a common question in computer science and has several practical applications.
Here are a few examples:

1. **Text Analysis**: This problem can be used in text analysis where you might need to find the longest sequence of unique characters.
This could be useful in tasks such as text classification, pattern recognition, or even in some aspects of natural language processing.

2. **Data Compression**: In data compression, this problem can be used to find the longest unique sequence of data.
This could help in optimizing the compression algorithm by identifying and eliminating redundant data.

3. **Cryptography**: In cryptography, finding unique patterns in a string can be useful.
For instance, if the string represents a cipher text, finding the longest substring without repeating characters could help in deciphering the text.

4. **Genomics**: In genomics, DNA sequences are represented as strings of characters.
Finding the longest substring without repeating characters could help identify unique patterns in the DNA sequence.

5. **Web Development**: In web development, this problem can be used in form validation.
For example, to check if a password or username has a certain number of unique characters.

Remember, these are just a few examples.
The actual applications can be much broader and depend on the specific requirements of your project.

=== Common Mistakes

When implementing the solution for the "Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem, there are several common mistakes that developers often make:

1. **Not Handling Edge Cases**: It's important to handle edge cases correctly, such as when the input string is empty or contains only one unique character.
These cases should return 0 and 1, respectively.

2. **Not Updating Pointers Correctly**: The sliding window technique used in this problem involves moving two pointers, `start` and `end`.
It's crucial to update these pointers correctly.
A common mistake is to forget to update the `start` pointer when a repeating character is found.

3. **Not Using the Right Data Structures**: The choice of data structures can significantly impact the performance of the solution.
Using a list instead of a set to store unique characters, for example, can lead to a higher time complexity because searching for an element in a list takes linear time.

4. **Not Returning the Correct Output**: The problem asks for the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Some developers might mistakenly return the substring itself or forget to return the length.

5. **Not Considering All Characters**: The input string can contain not only lowercase and uppercase English letters but also digits, symbols, and spaces.
It's a common mistake to only consider English letters in the solution.

6. **Not Testing Enough**: This problem has many edge cases, and it's important to test the solution with various inputs to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios.
A common mistake is to only test the solution with a few simple cases.

Remember, avoiding these common mistakes can help you implement a more robust and efficient solution.

=== Constraints

* `+0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10+`^`+4+`^
* `+s+` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

== Examples

=== Example 0

=== Example 1

[source,python,linenums]
----
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
----

=== Example 2

[source,python,linenums]
----
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
